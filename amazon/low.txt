Es muy facil de usar y su software de seguridad y de comprension es muy bueno lo recomiendo ampliamente. I gave this to my husband for making martinis and he loves it. UV olan? kendiliginden yerinden cikiyor. Yani vida disleri tutmuyor. Polarize olandan memnunum. Bu fiyat bundan iyisi beklenmez sanirim. It is a computer chip and works the way it is supposed to.  No grey area here. It worked for me. The only difference is the money in my pocket. I had problems with my PCs and now all off them are gone, I had over 600 virus, and since I installed this product haven't had problems. Asi es, la verdad me ha salido buenisimo, la bateria dura lo que debe de durar, aprox unas 8 horas.... Vino en buenas condiciones y es peque?o, cabe en la mano.... Lo recomiendo para corredores de media maraton, acaso piensan gastar 1GB de m?sica en todo el recorrido? lo dudo! Lo compre para no perderme en unas vacaciones por tierra en Estados Unidos. Excelentes Resultados. When using the 5120 I was getting repeated disconnects from World of Warcraft.  Replaced it with the Motorola Surfboard Broadband Cable Modem SB-5101 and all the problems are gone. After installing Webroot Spy Sweeper, 4 spyware programs were indentified. When a request was made to Zone Labs for assistance in the removal of these items, they would only refer me to Webroot and would not assist me because ZoneAlarm did not recognize the spyware  at all. Este producto es muy bueno, aunque en algunos momentos se inhibe. Es buenisimo, tiene una excelente calidad de sonido la duracion de las baterias es buena mas de 16 horas Excelente telefono, por eso se gano todos esos premios, lo unico malo es que lo meti en la lavadora de ropa y hasta ese momento duro. ES UN PRODUCTO ECONOMICO Y DE MUY BUENA CALIDAD, ES UNA BUENA SOLUCION PARA USUARIOS BASICOS This product was everything it was advertised to be. El pedido lleg? a tiempo y en buen estado.  Todo perfecto.  Lo recomiendo. recibi el equipo bien y sin problema , el unico detalle es que se tardo mucho en llegar, expecificamente se tardaron mucho en enviarlos, pero los recivi sin problemas y funcionando bien Muy buena, muy rapida y a un exelente precio, que mas se le puede pedir a una memoria. Es un gran producto, se obtiene a un gran precio pose la cualidad adicional que mide altimetro, es de boilsillo y es facil de llevar, ademas tiene disponible accesorios que pueden ser de utilidad Mi mam? es entomologa y los compr? para ella... mas que usarlos podr?a decir que los ha disfrutado...! la imagen es excelente y han sido muy utiles para ella..!! Los recomiendo mucho! Was very unhappy. This item was not compatable with Vista which is technology that most computers are going to. Existen otras herramientas en las que los diagramas de flujo ayudan a organizar las actividades en un proyecto de investigaci?n, pero ninguna iguala a Inspiration en cuanto a la capacidad de plasmar conceptos y actividades en forma gr?fica. Para mis asistentes de Investigaci?n, los mapas mentales construidos en este magn?fico software ilustran con rigor cient?fico la ruta de un proyecto, con sus pposibles alternativas y les permiten a partir de ah? desarrollar nuevas ideas. Este juego de fitros es una excelente opcion de compra para la calidad que tienen,cada uno cumple su trabajo a cabalidad;enroscan perfectamente en los 58 mm para los que fueron dise?ados,tiene su rosca macho que va al cuerpo de la camara o adaptador y rosca hembra,para recibir otro filtro adicional o un filtro de uso diario para protejer al que dejamos fijo en la camara,(casi siempre el uv;en mi caso.) Recomiendo altamente esta marca. espero que les sea de ayuda mi opinion. Exitos! The plot isn't very compelling, there are some funny lines, but visually this movie is a masterpiece, 5 stars. If they don't have any sizes in stock, and they don't then what's the point? gave this to my boyfriend for valentine's day and he loves it.  thank you. No RJ. The Toshiba 34HF85 is made and assembled by Orion (Sansui), not Toshiba. I have the proof and photos. Toshiba is lying to its customers. i got this item for my husband as a gift, and haven't had any problems with it at all. I liked the item except there was a delay in shipping. It took more than a week to recieve the material in hand. Unlike some of the other people that have reviewed I had no problem  with the warranty. Obviously I did have a issue with the buds (the one stopped working) but I had no problems at all getting them replaced. Soy un usuario un poco mas que amateur y mucho menos que profesional y esta camara me resulta realmente extraordinaria. Una gran cantidad de opciones y lo mas importante con una gran calidad!!! Estoy tomando mi primer curso de fotografia y la verdad cada vez me demuestra que es una gran camara. 100% recomendada. Excelente el producto pueden comprarlo sin  ningunproblema y la entrega fue  tal lo acordado... Econ?mico, ligero, y veloz. Soy profesor y requer?a un scannner peque?o y port?til que me permitiera subir con facilidad im?genes y materiales impresos a mi p?gina web. El LiDe 25 ha satisfecho de manera eficiente esta necesidad. Es port?til y c?modo de usar debido a que no requiere de fuente de poder. El software de reconocimiento de textos es muy eficiente, por lo que resulta sencillo convertir textos digitalizados a documentos Word. Su dise?o es moderno y atractivo, y su funcionamiento silencioso. Estoy muy satisfecho con mi adquisici?n. Excelente idea de hacer unos altavoces que mejoraran un poco el sonido de la consola PSP. El unico inconveniente que le veo es que si tambien tienes el cargador - asidero, no vas a poder usar ambos porque ocupan espacios iguales. Es por esto que se hace dificil cargar con ambos accesorios al  mismo tiempo. Cuando lo compre no estaba muy seguro pero es un buen monitor y en desempe?o es bastante bueno se lo recomiendo es una opcion muy buena El producto es bueno, s?lo que a veces se queda "colgado", y no responde al bot?n de apagado y necesariamente hay que extraer la pila para que pueda apagarse. Purchased financial calculator for my college accounting class. Meets all the requirements for course Exelente producto por DFI. Lo recomiendo 100%. el CMOS del BIOS es impresionantemente cofigurable. Nada dif?cil de ajustarlo a nuestras necesidades. No da problemas para instalar RAID's en Windows XP. Trae hasta una herramienta para sacar Jumpers. La refrigeraci?n es muy buena, tal vez un poco ruidozo el FAN del NB, pero del resto trae disipaci?n pasiva. :) Me gust? mucho esta tarjeta madre. L?stima que no la adquir? en vez de la MSI NEO4 Platinum que esta si que me dio todos los problemas del mundo. NO SE LA RECOMIENDO A NADIE. MSI Ha bajado calidad en sus productos. Lo siento por ellos. No tengo una queja del Jukebox... Reproduce a la perfecci?n cualquier tipo de archivo para el que dice tener soporte... es peque?o liviano y no se requieren muchos conocimientos para manipularlo Initially I liked this product. I've owned it 1 1/2 years and it died on me. I'm very disappointed. Reci?n lo he comprado.  Tenia muchas dudas si comprarlo o no.  Por que habia leido en los review, que se demoraba mucho para bajar las fotos. A penas lo compr? y despu?s de cargarlo, lo primero que hice fue probarlo.  Le meti una tarjeta SD que tenia y le baje las fotos.  Me pareci? que bajo rapidamente, no es lento ni rapido, podria decir que se demora lo que uno se demora cuando bajas la informacion a la computadora. Me gusta por que es peque?o pero algo pesadito. Lo que mas me gusta de esto, es que te sirve para bajar las fotos de tus tarjetas de memoria sin el uso de una computadora.  Es muy ?til cuando uno sale de viaje o quiz?s cuando est?s en una reuni?n y un amigo toma una foto que quisieras, simplemente le pides que te preste la tarjeta y lo bajas en tu wolverine. Lo tengo poco tiempo, as? que todav?a no le he encontrado algo que no me guste (si es que lo tiene) Lo que me gusto de este control remoto es la programaci?n a treves de la pc, sin embargo me desencanto un poco pues la interfas de usuario no es la idonea, pero al conocer el  programa me diverti agregando mis dispositivos y las actividades. Lo que no me gusto es el material de la carcasa es muy delicado y facil de da?ar, espero no romperlo tan pronto, hubiera sido mejor si le con material para absorver golpes. A la hora de usarlo con mi Centro de Entretemiento en general me siento satisfecho. I ordered. It came on time.  That's what I expected and that's what I got. si no tienes quien te pase los discos tas jodio.... y ademas videos pa it solo por que nisiquiera jan vendio el cableee pa mostrarlos.... tus vais a vel. si no tienes quien te pase los discos tas jodio.... y ademas videos pa it solo por que nisiquiera jan vendio el cableee pa mostrarlos.... tus vais a vel. (spanish) Es un muy buen producto, la marca es buena y tiene un precio justo comparado con otras marcas (spanish) Es un muy buen producto, la marca es buena y tiene un precio justo comparado con otras marcas trabaja bien sirve de ayuda en el control del bebe es de 110 voltios y yo lo queria en 220 pero lo resolvi con un transformador Only consern that I have is why this item comes with only 5 year warranty on all attached equipment? I had it on my snowmobile for 20 minutes before it stopped working. I have to admit that it was only -10 degrees outside. I had it on my snowmobile for 20 minutes before it stopped working. I have to admit that it was only -10 degrees outside. I have not received this item. Was I charged for this item? Kerry Paterson The product lasted only a week... and then it broke.  It was a waste of money. These wipes have more perfume in them than any wipe on earth.  They are about the same softness as the Kirkland brand, but cost a lot more.  And wooohoooo, they smell stronger than este lauder herself. I installed the Microsoft Suite 2006 and then the Pinnacle Studio 10. The pinnacle Studio 10 caused my computer to crash. I then had to replaced EVERYTHING on my computer. I lost all my photos. Excelente reproductor no solo en tama?o fisico sino de capacidad, muy solido , unicamente flaquea en momentos con los videos pero aparte de eso un excelente reproductor. Excelente creo  que  no  hay que  hablar  mucho  de ello, su capacidad lo dice todo.......Comprenla son problema simpre llenara sus requisitos.... Los Motorola Talkabout FV200AA GMRS son muy buenos equipos considerando su bajo precio. Los hemos utilizado en una distancia de aproximadamente 500 metros en l?nea vista en la ciudad y la recepci?n es muy buena. A 200 metros en la ciudad sin linea vista la senal se pierde. Los compre para mis hijas con el objetivo de ubicarlas en espacios abiertos en un rango de 250 metros y para este uso funcionan muy bien. I too purchased the product. It will not activate when you are in a network with a firewall. I e-mailed the company but no response. Everybody who gave it a 1 star rating is dumb. this is the product rating, not the website. A persar de que las comparaciones son odiosas, al ver esta pel?cula surgen constantemente las comparaciones con "Pesadilla antes de Navidad" (PADN). En mi opini?n no llega a tener el ritmo ni la profundidad en la historia que ?sta ?ltima. Aunque a nivel de imagen considero que los a?os han pasado a favor de la "Novia Cad?ver" lo cierto es que ni en la historia ni en la m?sica alcanza las cotas de PADN. La m?sica es muy parecida y la historia es bastante m?s floja y mucho m?s predecible. Hay elementos como el perro del protagonista en el Inframundo que son como el perro de PADN. A pesar de todo estoy muy satisfecho con la compra de este DVD y la recomiendo encarecidamente. Respecto a los Extras, te enteras de algunos detalles pero tampoco aportan gran cosa. Lo que s? me ha gustado mucho ha sido la opci?n de poder ver la pel?cula solo con la banda sonora. It was a gift for our son who is in the Navy - he LOVES it!! Includes everything needed in a phone, CallerID, PhoneBook, HeadPhone connection etc. One disadvantage is that it cannot be expanded to more than two units. Toam. viejo, es de los mejores reproductores ke hay, inteligente, y la interfaz del programa es amistosisima, la verdad es muy inteligente, hasta ahora no le veo peros, ya le puse video, musica y fotos, no me arrepiento, sin duda, comprenlo, no se van a arrepentir !!!! No complaints. Purchased a 2nd one for my teen. Rec'd within the week. I got this camera as a gift and I am very happry with it. El proveedor fue muy r?pido y el producto excelente. Se ajusta perfectamente a mi c?mara Fuji. It suddenly stops working after a few uses, I lost all Data Stored.. The description of the product was deceiving.  The photo showed a router and 2 handsets.  The description talked about the router and both handsets.  All I received was 1 handset. its just as i thought it would be and it seems flawless My tape deck kept flipping it over and after a few minutes spit it out.  That was a waste of money... This software is very limited.  There are very few backgrounds,  the clipart is uninteresting.  there are very few frames and borders.  The photo tool is primitive.  I expected more from a product with the creating keepsakes name on it.  this product is a waste of time and money. I purchased three of the 1GB units for christmas.Two have died by May. I would not recomend buying these's units. El producto en general es interesante, pero tiene algunas desventajas en mi humilde opini?n - A menos que se tenga una muy prolija y excelente letra, la migraci?n de los textos a Word es deficiente - Es dificil de conseguir repuestos de los grafos localmente - El l?piz resulta un tanto grueso, espero en futuras evoluciones, puedan reducir el tama?o del mismo En general, aceptable y ?til. no tengo tres meses de recibir mi cp y el mismo ya presenta problemas a nivel del cd o dvd desde hace unas tres semanas, quisiera una orientacion de garantia paraa solucionar mi problema Considero que su mejor caracter?stica es su velocidad de lectura/escritura, aspecto q la hace muy apropiada para trabajos profesionales. Si bien es cierto, existen presentaciones con mejores rates en estos aspectos, la Extreme III es excelente. Personalmente manejo varias memorias de 2 o 4 Gb y la Extreme III se presta para esto La recomiendo. I have had this stereo in service more than I have had it in my home. Me gusta muchoel producto , su peso es genial, lo mejor es la pantalla, la memoria es compartida con el video eso quiere decire que es de 512 - 128 eso es un defecto pero es muy rapido, lo tengo en una red inalambrica y funciana perfecto la velocidad es buena. El peso del equipo es adecuado y se puede trabsportar facilmente. En pocas palabras es un a buena compra Now have 3 of these units can`t be beat for the money!!!! Mucho mejor de lo esperado el producto, muy f?cil de navegaci?n, de cargar la m?sica y en men? muy intuitivo, lo ?nico medio molestoso son los aud?fonos, un tanto inc?modos, pero cuesti?n de adaptarse. Recomendable Es un excelente producto y funciona bien. Lo tengo instalado en Costa Rica. Al principio tuve algunos problemas, pero adquir? un nuevo router, de los recomendados por Slingmedia y solicit? a mi proveedor de internet que abrieran los puertos y listo. Cero problemas. Eso s?, se debe de tener acceso a mas 512 kbs, para que se pueda ver bien fuera de casa. Para aquellos que tienen wireless es una bonita opci?n para tener tv en cualquier parte de la casa. Does what it says it does: allows you to input tapes and lps to your mac. The PC system requirements did not address the compatibility with MAC OSX but I connected the player to my IMAC, ignored loading the supplied CD, and dragged music from ITUNES without any problem. The only "similarity the inventory management, is the capability to enter pluses and minuses to a list of SQUs. Aunque no conocia esta marca, me arriesgu? por sus caracter?sticas t?cnicas y qued? gratamente sorprendido. Presenta una imagen sin igual. Colores, contraste, y velocidad superior. Comparados con otras marcas muy conocidas y de precio muy superior (como el otro que compr?) el N2050W 20 las deja 5 a?os atras. la c?mara es incre?ble, pero el lente al ser un Zoom no es muy luminoso, por lo que hay que compensar con el iso de la c?mara, incluso 1600, pero ah? la imagen pierde nitidez aparece el grano. El trasmisor funciona bien. Nada excelente pero tampoco nada malo. Al menos puedo escuchar mp3 en mi carro. La calidad del sonido es bastante aceptable y con poca interferencia. Lo mejor es que puedo escuchar mi musica aleatoria. Purchased this product for the AADP and AVRCP Bluetooth profiles that are NOT included with the Toshiba Bluetooth stack. Works as avertised. Lots of bells and whistles. Does a fair job but is overpriced. Compre la rebel xt primero por el precio, soy dise?ador gr?fico y trabajo con webs, y esta camara tiene suficiente poder para dedicarme solo a la fotografia profesional. He usado antes camaras canon y son muy buenas pero esta es una buena opcion para quienes inician en la fotografia profesional o fotografos mas avanzados. Tiene 5 puntos de enfoque que se pueden manipular para lograr efectos muy buenos, y una rafaga de disparos continuos de unos 12 disparos en unos 2a3 seg. Como detalle tambien les aclaro que el lente ef-s 18-55 que trae se queda corto para hacer acercamientos entonces tengan por seguro que tendran que adquirir otro lente. Otras baterias tambien son otra buena opcion para comprar puesto que si usan mucho el screen para revisar las fotografias se consumen bastante rapido.  Bueno, la verdad yo si la recomiendo. The highest volume setting is barely audible. The options are limited. More profit for an American company at the expense of Americans. esta es mi segunda compra y la verdad no tengo queja ya que he adquirido articulos electronicos que es un poco delicardos comprarlos por este medio, pero no he tenido ningun problema y los invito a comprar en amazon su compra estara segura y garantizada Estoy muy contento con la c?mara, el ?nico defecto que le he encontrado es que el volumen al grabar video MPEG4 es exageradamente bajo....  parecen pel?culas mudas y ruidosas.  Por lo dem?s es muy buena. Compr? este reproductor hace un par de semanas basado en las revisones de otros usuarios. Antes ten?a un reprodutor Creative y este lo supera en un 100%. Todo lo que promete el fabricante se cumple. La duraci?n de la bater?a es de alrededor de 11 a 14 horas. El fabricante constantemente actualiza el firmware del equipo. Entre la cosas negativas que encuentro de este modelo esta el control con una especie de Joystick que es un poco complicado de usar al principio. Lo segundo negativo es la poca facilidad de pasar videos al formato exigido. A pesar de que el equipo viene con el software Jetaudio y permite el traspaso de video, esta operaci?n a mi no me ha resultado. Lo tercero es que no trae un estuche para guardarlo.. (se vende por separado) En conclusi?n, comparado con otras marcas es mucho mejor. Si tuviera que comprarlo de nuevo.... lo har?a. purchased it for a gift for my brother and got it two days after I ordered it. I received the item in a timely fashion and it was just what I needed. Needs an index in the instruction book listing the name of the city for the 3 letter code displayed. And a listing showing what batteries are used. Wow - 50 sheet feeder, 20 ppm, solves my document management problem Mcafee does not acknowledge that rebate materials have been submitted or they deny the rebate and delay...etc. Very disappointed in machine.  Wanted the American Idol machine with 2 mic's and ordered this because it showed the cordless and 2nd microphone.  Over priced for the item. After using for over a month the priter, - for reasons unknown - fails to print - advances 1 label & shows printer errors thereafter Solves the cooling problem where my CPUs are in computer desk that has a tight area with limited airflow. I gave this to my daughter for Christmas, as it is what she wanted and she said that it took a couple of times for the milk to steam properly and the part where you had to hand tighten was tricky, in that if it was too loose it leaked, but now that she has worked out the kinks, she loves it. In response to Mehul Bavishi, this is not a 3CCD camcorder.  According to their literature, it is a single 1/4.5" CCD. Product was as listed and delivery was prompt. Would not hesitate to deal with vendor in the future. I boutht this product because i had an urgency in the office. This came out better than I thought... it is very sturdy, we are currently using it with 17" monitors. The only down side why I not giving the 5th star is because it doesn't have a cable management... your monitor's cables will have to be strapped to the arm... no way to hide them. It must be explicit with de color name... or linkeable While I was initially attracted to this product for the sterling glamour of its silvery surface, this soon tarnished once I began operating its more than yielding button interface. Yes, it is very generous in how it allows you to press and poke it to command a number of operations; but it is almost too generous, and with each push of a button it sinks into disrepute, servility and debasement. I once esteemed its silvery resplendence. This product now impresses me as nothing more than painted chattel to be abused by paupers and mendicants, to daub with their oily fingers. I can have no more of this disreputable product. This is not delivered to specified location. But I got refunded the money that I spend on it. I got this one just for fun as I'm a very amateur photographer and I can only praise the EOS350D (which is the EU name for this camera) Cuando compre era la mejor bateria aaa  que hab?a al mejor precio. La calidad y duraci?n son excelentes. Recomiendo ?nicamente la compra de ?sta o de la energizer, son las mejores. No desperdicien su dinero en otras marcar. Por ultimo quiero dejar en claro que le he puesto cuatro estrellas y no cinco porque una semana despu?s de haber comprado encontre (no en amazon) que ya existe la de 1000 mA que no hab?a ac?. Busquela por las dudas antes de comprar. Al fin encontr? un control remoto que realmente es universal, porque tiene una gran lista de dispositivos con sus c?digos, y si no estuviera en la lista, se puede programar, para que aprenda las funciones desde el control original. Funciona perfectamente en mi televisor Aiwa, para el que no encontraba control que le funcionara, este si. El unico defecto que le encuentro, es que el material parece un poco fr?gil y resbaladizo, se me cay? una vez y ahora tiene un ruido en el interior, como de una pieza quebrada. Totalmente Recomendado. This is an inexpensive PSU, i have it working for 6 months without any problems. It was given as a gift to my boy friend he needed it and wanted it. It arrived promply. Explanation was vague, the picture was not the same product. There was no " sync" button on the cradle as is common with most, making syncing more difficult This is the 3rd Kingston DataTraveler that we've bought, and we've had no trouble using them to transfer data, music, or pictures from one computer to another. I purchased this as a gift for my niece having a baby and she was very thrilled with this product. I purchased this as a gift for my niece having a baby and she was very thrilled with this product. Funciona bien pero no es del todo fino en el transmisor. Por momentos genera ruido. It's ok, noisy in certain moments. Funciona bien pero no es del todo fino en el transmisor. Por momentos genera ruido. It's ok, noisy in certain moments. Got this for a 27" flatscreen in my bedroom and it was just what I needed for the price I liked. Mine just went through the washer and then through the dryer. I plugged it in... and IT WORKS...!!!!!!!! Este es mi segundo WRT54G, ahora "GL". No he revisado el firmware de linksys, ya que inmediatamente le puse Tomato, sin embargo es un router de muy larga tradici?n y personalmente nunca he tenido problemas con la marca Linksys. Estuve pensando si comprar este modelo o el nuevo "G2" o alguno de la nueva serie, pero si bien son m?s estilizados, no creo que ofrezcan la versatilidad de estos, sobre todo este modelo que es compatible con Linux y por medio de firmwares alternativos se puede sacar lo mejor de su hardware, como es el caso con Tomato u otros como dd-wrt, openwrt, etc. Lo utilizo conectado a un modem adsl en modo "bridge", as? que el router hace la negociaci?n PPPoE y adquiere directamente la ip p?blica, me ha resultado muy confiable, lo recomiendo. This is OK and does the job I wanted it for Delivery was on time. It's bigger and better than the one that I had before. What more could I ask for. This o6 quickbooks asked me to register, it needed the phone number and postcode of the prior owner. I didn't have that so I called in to be  informed by Intuit that Amazon is not supposed to sell used copies of quickbooks, and they have an agreement to this effect. My quickbooks is inoperable. $70 down the tubes. boo!!! Muy buena adquisici?n.  El beb? se siente c?modo y confortable. If you're a runner the garmin 305 is a must have. It does everything I expected and more. It is so on the money on the distance part,my buddy ran with me on a course that we had measured with a car and he bought one about a week later. O rel?gio ? muito bom, facil de configurar e muito f?cil de ser usado. Os mapas podem ser transferidos para a web onde ? poss?vel fazer uma an?lise de todo o exerc?cio. ?nico se n?o fica por conta do tamanho, ele ? um pouco grande e precisa de um tempo de adapta??o para correr com ele no pulso, mais voc? acaba acostumando. I started using the exersaucer when my son was four months because he could control his head.  I loved the toy because I felt safe using it at such a young age.  My son's favorate part of the toy was the circus tent that spins and lights up.  Unfortuanately, the batteries in the circus tent are NOT replacable.  The circus tent stopped lighting up and playing music about a month and half after we purchased the item.  Now my son has lost interest in the exersaucer since it no longer lights up or plays music. The biggest problem I had with this product is that it's made from fleece and as a result, our daughter was over heating every single night! I am very satisfied with this.  I have a smaller one and I needed a bigger one and they are both SanDisk. Two days after receiving this player, it stopped playing MP3 files,  we just got an annoying buzz.  I've returned it for a refund. Submitted Rebate which was rejected because I had only included the UPC code but not an inside flap of the box. It was stated once in the submission form but in 2 other areas they only asked for the UPC code. After reading the reviews, I don't have any confidence in the software and will switch to Norton. At least they are a respectable company. Can anybody tell me if this unit cames with the charging stand and if the unit is made in japan????? This tv has been dissapointing for us.  Shortly after installing picture started flashing, flickering & rolling for no apparent reason.  We troubleshooted thinking it might be other equipment affecting the picture but realize now that it's a defective tv.  I cringe at the prospect of dealing with customer service centers, tv repairmen & warranty limitations. JB weld is one of the most useful tools that a homeowner can have in the toolchest. I have used it for over 10 years & repaired hundreds of items. It's uses are endless. I got this receiver as a Christmas gift Dec. 07.  It is in the service shop after a week of service due to overwhelming smell coming from receiver when turned on. I described the smell to JVC customer service as "acrid, smokey, toxic, headache causing smell".  The unit is operational, but just not possible to be in the same room with it when its on. Tuve el placer de escuchar el Hifi de Apple, el Onstage de JBL (muy bueno pero carece de control remoto), el BOSE y el Klipsh IGroove. Termine comprando el IGroove. Definitivamente el mejor entre los anteriormente nombrados. Ahora bien, tiempo despues, vi el Klipsh IFI por internet. Me llamo la atencion por que tiene Subwoofer. Siempre me ha gustado el toque que le da el subwoofer a la musica, de manera pues que no me pude aguantar y lo compre. Este es definititivamente el mejor de los mejores. La calidad del sonido es espectacular. Si tienen el dinero y el espacio (es mas grande que los anteriormente nombrados) no les quepa la menor duda de que este es el mejor equipo que le puedes colocar a tu IPOD. Lo recomiendo ampliamente.

The reason why I liked this software is that It covers everything (alphapets,Grammmer,...). if you are motivated, you will deffinatly learn Arabic Language. I have to disconect it at least 5 times a day because it suddenly gets stuck in a key stroke and keeps typing it until you disconect it phisically Este equipo es muy bueno, le permite supervisar de cerca la evolucion de tus ejercicios. El color es muy lindo y agradable. Lo compre para mi esposa y esta super feliz y super delgada gracias a la ayuda y la informacion que este reloj le brinda en sus ejercicios. Lo recomiendo. estas baterias recargables las compre como extras para mi camara dsc w-5 sony y tienen buena duracion y a un excelente precio Foi uma de minhas melhores aquisi??es dos ?ltimos tempos. O custo benef?cio ? excelente... A operacionalidade do aparelho ? bastante simples. Os recursos s?o excelentes, a sincroniza??o de faixas ? muito simples e o aparelho ainda ? bonito. Al?m disso a op??o do slot de expans?o ? bastante ?til. Reproduz v?rios formatos de ?udio, al?m de fotos, v?deos, R?dio e gravador (o gravador funciona inclusive no r?dio). Bom mesmo. My TV has just failed after only 3 1/2 years.  there are countless reports of other customers with the same problem.  Sony extended the warranty on other RPTV LCDs made around the same time, but they have not done so for this model.  Avoid at all costs.  100% failure rate. It is clearly a stab at showing the contrast between Calvinism and Arminianisn concerning the doctrine of predestination. Too bad they could not spell ARMINIAN correctly! ...Yo lamento mucho escribir este reporte para un tel?fono de marca TAN PRESTIGIOSA, pero la verdad este producto no me funcion? para nada bien. La recepci?n es terrible, a una corta distancia de la base y 2-3 muros de por medio y olv?dese de utilizar el tel?fono pues la recepci?n es nula!. Puede ser que ?ste tel?fono espec?fico tuviese alg?n defecto, pero lamentablemente en Amazon me informaron que no ten?an existencias en stock para reemplazarlo, as? que mi ?nica opci?n fue devolverlo y casi de inmediato Amazon me reitegr? mi dinero. ?Que pas? Motorola?, pilas ah? !!! The service was excelent, The time of delivery excelent, The support was excelent, The product excelent. I SHURE WAS DISAPOINTED WITH THE TERK HDTV ANTENNA. IT WOULD ONLY PICKUP A FEW CHANNELS.IN FACT I'M GOING TO SELL IT This item has worked out better than i thought. I have been using it at home and office. This item has worked out better than i thought. I have been using it at home and office. For Christmas I purchased my husband a computer backpack.  It was not a Brenthaven, so he returned it.  He now has a Brenthaven and carries it everyday. According to him it is the only backpack for the true Macophile. Has saved my present computer from attacks that made it through in the past. This product did not perform as advertised.  Pantone is in the process of replacing this unit with an upgrade which, hopefully will solve the problem.  I understand this product is being taken off the market until their situation is resolved.  Pantone is being very upfront and responsible in this matter. I am against spanking, but if there's anyone who deserves to be spanked it's Dobson! For writing all those slick, UN-scientific, cruel and stupid books about beating children with belts, wooden boards, and whips. If Dobson was beaten the way he recommends children be beaten, maybe he'd actually wake up to the fact that his methods are inhumane, humiliating and dangerous. On the other hand, I strongly suspect Dobson has a spanking fetish, since he speaks so fondly of being whipped with his mother's fancy girdle. He'd probably enjoy a spanking, the guy is sick and a disgrace to Christianity. Systemworks traditionally has done everything with satisfaction for me.  But I recently tried trend micros pc-cillin 2007 internet security and I thought that was edge above all the other software out there I've tried.  I catches just about everything. Stacks up to Family Tree Maker and others at half the cost! Finds hot spots and identifies them. Does what it says. PERIOD! Why is it that Amazon is charging more money ($595.00)for Quickbooks 2006 than Quickbooks 2007 (169.00)? I have gotten two of these devices and both have locked up on me. There is no support online and no one can figure out how to reset it. Don't waste your money! I am a personal Chef and this product has made costing and menu planning a breeze. Thank you! I have just spent an hour trying to customize a certificate from one of their templates. No success! This product is not at all intuitive; the Help is not helpful; there is no tutorial; there's no explanation of what's on the 8 CR-ROMs included.  A waste of time and money. I had this for about nine months now and it is absolutely fabulous. I recommand this if you are looking for a budget HDTV and space is not a problem for you. Very disappointed.  This was my son's 13th birthday present.  After about 1 week the left speaker quit working. This is a stylish looking unit. The only issue I have with the product is it should be easier to change the volume. I'm not Mr. Linux.  I loaded DD-WRT from windows.  It works. Bought it to prove that the connection problems I had were with COMCAST.  My son, Mr. Engineer, suggested it. Now I can log COMCAST's problems. The product description says to match Sony DCR-DVD105, which is completly FALSE. I just got the len and is worthless. I expected a card as advertised, with pin connections on the card, but received the three cards without the pin connections. I needed that for the front panel connections on my computers. where is the 3rd mic? It shows a wireless mic and it is not there. i ampleased with the quality of the discs AND with the speed of delivery ! I noticed that the protective case and installation software were missing, so I called SanDisk. To my surprise, I was told that the product was used therefore they were not responsible for the missing items. Doesn't export in any useable format.  You can only export recipes in text or MasterCook format, you can't export into MS Word format to backup or share a collection of your recipes or menus--you can email them out. I have been looking for something... and this is it!!! It makes you move to another joyful place while you are wearing it.... excelente equipo compatible con linux , me permite efectuar y colocar programas en linux dentro del router. alta potencia 250 miliwatt Esto es para los de habla hispana. Este DVD Recorder es de batalla, trabaja muy bien, yo estoy viviendo en la ciudad de M?xico. Es muy flexible a la hora de editar video como por ejemplo acortando t?tulos, quitar comerciales de programas de TV, nombrar tus t?tulos. Excelente. El programar las grabaciones que quieras de tu TV es muy intuitivo y f?cil de usar. La grabaci?n a DVD no es complicada, ya que teniendo los t?tulos en el disco duro, puedes escoger de entre los que tengas y pasarlos al DVD. Lo que s? no pude hacer es ver este DVD en mi DVD de mi computadora, a?n tengo que ver por qu?, pero se me hace raro, porque los DVD players pueden tocar estos DVD sin ning?n problema. Gracias. WOW! IS THIS A HOAX? I GOT THE BOX PROMPTLY BUT WITH NOTHING IN THE BOX I purchased this for my nephew who was thrilled to have an mp3 player only to have it and a replacement player die within days (freeze problem). I'll avoid this brand in future. This Heart Rate Monitor is slim, unobtrusive, and essential to maintaining effective and safe heart rates while exercising. I wouldn't be without it. Execelente qualidade de som, funciona com pilhas comuns ou baterias recarreg?veis cujo pre?o ? bem menor em compara??o com uma bateria de ipod, por exemplo. O fone de ouvido que vem com o produto ? de ?tima qualidade, e todos os acess?rios tamb?m s?o impressionantes. Este aparelho vem com um adaptador para usb, um cabo para usb, j? vem com capinha para o player, cabo para pendurar o player no pesco?o, um fio p2 p2 para captura de som e v?rios softwares de excelente qualidade. O seu visor com variadas cores ? algo muito bonito e que chama muito a aten??o tamb?m. H? apenas um por?m nesse palyer, e est? no fato de ele ser um pouco incompativel ao tentar lig?-lo a um mini system via entrada rca. O player tem uma saida de fone de ouvido de 16 ohms e acho que de alguma forma as entradas rca que tentei coloca-lo n?o foram muito compativeis com ele pois o som ficava meio distorcido mas se o uso for somente com fones de ouvido n?o h? incompatibilidade nenhuma. ? um excelente player. I found this machine to be adequate, beautifully designed and moderately priced one thing though it should have been sold with a telephone line for the internet. and a complimentary rewritable DVD. The FPE-3205 has an inverter problem that will kill your picture in about a year. I bought it at BJs too.  Now I have a 40# paperweight. The part is not readily available, and Audiovox will not stand behind this product. I hooked this up and was on my way to dvd recording in minutes. Newest Sakhalin oil industry practical English Russian and Russian English terminology and phrases! RECOMMENDED The software could not be installed on my eMac running OS 10.3.9.

I gave this as a holiday gift and they loved it. Instant battery boost without compromising your friend's vehicle. Beats booster cables any day. It is as it says... Printer ink, which is helpful when one wants the printer to produce a legible product. Received it on time.  No damage and it works as it is suppose to. it interferes with my wireless linksys system,it wipes it out despite changing network frequencies,I gave it away to a relative who does not have the same the same situation hopefully he will not have the same problem. The company viewed this microscope as a stocked item.  I purchased and received confirmation that it was being shipped.  2 days before Christmas I receive an E-mail that they are sorry but the item will not be shipped until after Christmas.  Thanks I would have looked somewhere else.  My child will be so excited looking for her gift under the Christmas tree... I've tried a number of approaches to organizing and reporting my expenses, none of which have been effective. NeatReceipts is. I have found it to be very useful. Excelenteo producto. Gran empaque, trae como valor agregado el convertidor a SD Card. Tal como siempre se ha categorizado SanDisk "EXCELENTE PRODUCTO" Since purchasing the SB5120 Surfboard by Motorola, I have noticed no difference in performance from my previous Motorola Surfboard. For me,  a waste of money. Gave this Garmin NuviGPS to our Son in Law for Christmas and he loves it. Thinking of getting one for myself. I did a lot of research and settled on this one.It is very colorful and has a mobile.It has a lot of activities and music too.The seat is very comfy too.My baby loved and used it from about 2 months to 6months. bottomline, it works with no issues flash it with dd-wrt and some increased db antennas and you are in business 512MB disk is additional memory for my wife's camera that gives her 1GB for all her picture action. If I could rate the product, 11.0 upgrade, I would rate it zero stars. This thing is Sweet!  I bought it at the mall with my mom on my 25th birthday.  The only thing I can't understand is how to attach the armband part for jogging and working at the gym! I seriously hope that the price tag I am seeing is ($7,000+) is a mistake... Prompt service.  This was a xmas gift and the recipient was delighted.  I have a Garmin myself and would be lost (literally) without it. Have been dealing with other Wall Arms for my other LCD's. This one was deffinately properly designed. From ease of hanging the LCD on the premounted plate to the a conduit that hides allt he cables. A+ product Purchased 2 SanDisk M240 MP3 players as gifts for Christmas.  one item failed within 2 days, the other item only operated for about 30 days. I hate it when the review mechanism is used as advertising space by vendors. I followed the product instructions and got the ePen up and running. Liked using it because it's different from other mouse designs. It stopped charging within 1 week. The manufacturer didn't respond to my calls (left messages but no reply). My email inquiry was bounced. went through 3 of these  they short out or over heat or are just are poorly made You have to place the speakers then wire them with 16 or 18 (16 better) speaker wire to the speaker then splice them into the sony speaker wires attached to speakers. EN EL DIA DE HOY RECIBI DOS CONTROL REMOTO PARA USARLO EN UN TV PHILIPS 42 LCD Y CREANME FUNCIONA IGUAL QUE EL CONTROL ORIGINAL. LA ENTREGA DEL PRODUCTO FUE A TIEMPO. ESTOY MUY CONTENTO GUARDE EL CONTROL ORIGINAL Y ESTOY USANDO UNO DE LO QUE COMPRE. EXCELENTE, BUENO Y BARATO. OJALA PODER DARLE 10 ESTRELLAS EN VEZ DE 5. este peque?o aparatico nos salvo las vacaciones, no habia tiempo ni espacio para cargar y bajar nuestras fotos en un pc asi que solo con el ipod y este accesorio pudimos bajar mas de 3 mil fotos de nuestro viaje con total comodidad, es un poco lento pero sencillo practico y seguro. lo recomiendo 1000%!!!! ademas es muy economico Everything is working properly. Everything was in the box that was supposed to be. Very satisfied. Thanks. Our ComCast supplied modem was requiring frequent resetting. Our guru had been having the same problem. He switched to this modem and reported no resetting and faster speed. Ours has been very reliable, and we have recommended this modem to others. This is and does exactly what it claims. There were a few bumps with software idiosyncracies, as with any software, but these were easlily addressed by doing the obvious, consulting help files, or contacting support, the latter of which took a total of 10 minutes. I'm very satisfied. I ordered and then had to return this item.  I have a 55" projection TV that supports 1080i and when running components through this box received an unwatchable amount of intereference. My son loves this.  Keeps him busy for awhile and is inspiring.  The only problem we had was there was a latch broken off when we received it.  This has not proved to be a problem though because we do not plan on folding it up to travel with us. The item was shipped as promised and was of the quality expected.  Thank you. I'm very satisfied by both the Forerunner and the delivery of the product. I've been using it for golf, mtb, rollerblades and running. I just can't wait until winter comes so I can try it out on mountainskiing Estou no Brasil. S? compro na Amazon e sempre deu tudo certo. A entrega ? imediata e sem burocracia. O produto ? bom e atende ?s minhas necessidades. I bought this as a gift for a friend who uses clothe diapers.  She loved it. Reviewer: Mister Quickly "Amazon epicurean" (Victoria, BC Canada) While I was initially attracted to this product for the sterling glamour of its silvery surface, this soon tarnished once I began operating its more than yielding button interface. Yes, it is very generous in how it allows you to press and poke it to command a number of operations; but it is almost too generous, and with each push of a button it sinks into disrepute, servility and debasement. I once esteemed its silvery resplendence. This product now impresses me as nothing more than painted chattel to be abused by paupers and mendicants, to daub with their oily fingers. I can have no more of this disreputable product. <<<< DOES THIS GUY KNOW HOW TO PARTY OR WHAT????? My wife loves this.  Her only complaint is occasionally she will hear a slight hiss in the background.  It seems we may have something in the house that is generating some noise in the transmisison. Item was as listed.  Not a huge amount of space, but was just what I needed.  The arm band and plastic case were a bonus. I agree with EVERYTHING said in the review with the same heading as mine. Piece of JUNK! I BOUGHT THIS AND THE RASTA STYLE SKULLCANDY HEADPHONES FOR OUR SKATEBOARDING SON FOR CHRISTMAS...BOTH HAVE ALREADY BLOWN OUT AND WE'RE ONLY IN THE 1ST OF APRIL...I'M MAKING THIS COMMENT ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THESE SKULLCANDY...I WAS DUMB AND PAYED 29.99 FOR EACH PAIR....SO SAD... I bought this for my daughter who is taking piano lessons.  We needed a touch sensitive keyboard.  After reading the reviews, I settled on this one.  We couldn't be happier.  My daughter loves it.  It is going to meet our piano needs for years now. Bought the product for my husband for a Christmas gift and it arrived on time and he loves it and it has made his job a lot easier After 2 days, my order was cancelled because it was out of stock.... I hate that! WARNING THIS COMPANY IS PREPARING TO SHUT DOWN OVER A FINANCIAL DISPUTE. THERE IS NO SERVICE BEING PROVIDED FROM THEM SO THIS PHONE IS WORTHLESS.  IF  ANYONE KNOWS OF ANOTHER PROVIDER THAT OJO PHONES WORK WITH IM ALL EARS. HAVE MULTIPLE PHONES WITH RELATIVES ALL OVER. Just wanted something to store my files, as a backup, and it serves the purpose. I placed my order on 26 Sept. 2005. Just now received notification of another delay with shipping sometime between 4 and 15 Nov 2005. Do the math........that's approximately 7 weeks for those that can't count! This thing is worthless.  I bought it for road trips, but it barely works in the car.  Tons of static. This radio does not have weather alert despite the description claming otherwise and the battery backup only backs up the time... so if the power fails in a storm you're out of luck. This product works as advertised. It's fully adjustable and lets you seek to any unused frequency. I was looking for an slide scanner and I feel I found what I was looking for. The tracks have a tic that repeats every second, i.e. all voice recordings have a tic tic tic tic in the background. This thing is slick.  Was nervous with just 2 screws holding to wall; but is very sturdy. But noooo, I went ahead and bought one of these for my home office.  My biggest complaint is that if you're talking on line 1, and another call comes in on line 2, the answering machine does not answer it!  It lets it just ring and ring.  Unacceptable. I ordered and received my ink within a of couple days! I couldn't be happier! I have 3 of these which I bought for using in my car (for my daughter), for travelling and one for my sister. I have opened and used 2 of them and I have faced absolutely no issues. I have 3 of these which I bought for using in my car (for my daughter), for travelling and one for my sister.

I ordered ink on the 28th and received it on the 30th...now that's what I call service :-) COBY, 2.4 GHZ Cordless Phone, CD Player, AM/AM Alarm Clock, Radio Bought for my daughter and she loves it. I agree with the comment below.  I was under the assumption as the previous reviewer.  I would pay about $5 with no shipping but no more.  It basically is more cosmetic than productive. Although the recording quality is acceptable, I was very disappointed that the recorder did not have built-in jacks for external headphones and a microphone. I had a normal CF for my fuji 9100 but it was slow.After changed to this CF, the speed is greatly improved. Me deshice de 3 controles para quedarme solo con este. Controla perfectamente  TV Toshiba, DVD Sony y Audio Amp/Tuner Sony. Me sucedi? que algun codigo no controlaba todas las funciones del aparato, solo es de seguir buscando otro codigo de los que estan en lista y encontrar?n uno que si controle todo. In response to rose, the D50 does not support a verticle shutter release. Technicaly, neither did the D70/D70s. Hoodman got around it by using a fiber optic cable to trigger the infared release. Be warned, the player will not play copy protected WMA files from subscription services such as Yahoo music and Walmart. I'm very disappointed and angry. The most dramatic race of the year for me was the San Marino GP.  This was the race that rookie Alonso held off the World Champion for ten laps to win.  They could've shown any number of those final laps while explaining the significance of what was taking place.  But no, they added a Euro Techno Crap soundtrack and thought that somehow, that alone would do this historic moment in Grand Prix racing justice.  It doesn't work! Very disappointed with this item.  It doesn't hold a charge for more than 2 hours at a time.  Once plugged in and charging, it gets unbelievably hot - my toddler picked it up and dropped it while hugging his hands to his body like he burned himself.  I thought he must have overreacted when feeling the warmth... but then *I* picked it up and thought - wow!  something is wrong here!  It would have burned his sensitive skin if he happened to have been watching it when propped on his belly/knees like usual - if he had sone so while plugged in.  VERY disappointed.  Would have requested a refund from Amazon, but in the Xmas rush we tossed the box, don't have anything but the unit and accessories anymore.  Will be contacting the company.  - Mom to John, age 4 It's ink, for heaven's sake. It works in the printer-- Canon to Canon. Amen. Enter your recipes, ingredients, select your meals, print grocery lists and you have your meals organized. This Monster Power center had all the features I was looking for.  It does not disappoint.  No problems with the device or the service.  Got it for a steal on Amazon. I ordered these for Christmas gifts and all 3 were defective; reordered and 2 more are defective.  Recipients were very unhappy NAV 2005 on my machines had the annoying "must activate" every few days, so I upgraded to NAV 2006.  During install, NAV claims you must uninstall ZoneAlarm. So I did.  But I'm annoyed at the lack of advance warning for that, and the nagging feeling that this is a ploy to upself to the Norton firewall.  However, NAV did not destroy my machine, and the performance doesn't seem all that bad.  YMMV. I was not impressed at all.  I have more components than jacks on my television, so I eagerly awaited the arrival of this switcher.  After following the directions and installing the unit, I noticed severe degradation in video signal.  It is now sitting somewhere in my closet. We returned a competing product.  This label maker - although requiring additional downloads and info from Dymo (which we obtained prior to ordering) - works with Mac and the Mac contacts.  Thankfully. I like McAfee but I have been unable to update my internet security suite with this version 8.  I have performed the recommended corrections from their trouble shooting site..but it has not worked.  I will just have to wait for the newer version. Power Adapter included.  Same model as the one my child trains with at school. These lower priced Shure earphones are adequate for most listening. They don't have the deep bass of the higher priced models but they are a quality product for their price. This shredder jams repeatedly. It's the second Fellows shredder that I have had over the years and they both jammed a lot. You can not program this piece of junk to alarm on just one particlar day of the week.It will alarm everyday,weekends,or mon-fri.If you wanted  it to alarm on just monday,you cant do it.An other product from Chine that has an user guide the is useless. Sleek and effective - does the job.  plastic clip can breakoff -it has happened to me twice so be careful if you attach it to a belt or a waist band on clothing.

Over the last 45 years, or so, I have amassed close to 9,000 slides, in varoiud formats; 16 mm, 35 mm, 2-14" and 2-1/4" X 3-14". I am scanning and edting all the pictures for my family.

I am scanning and edting all the pictures for my family. The scanner does a wondeful job. I like it ok.  I have had some problems with it.  Freezes up alot and i have some problems downloading songs onto it. After spending 2 months trying to swadle my son with tiny receiving blankets, I heard about this product. And I am so glad that I did. Although my son is very active and strong, he could not succeed taking his arms out of it, and he slept longer periods. This product is all that it's cracked up to be. I had purchased a Nuvi 660, but it's not designed fro geocaching, the 60CSx fills the bill. I agree with the other review who gave it 2 stars. text editor is worthless. No spell check. No word count. whats the point BEWARE this cable is not a universal fit.  All through the product description this appears to be a universal printer cable, no mention of potential incompatibility.  But when received and opened, the parallel connector is not compatible with my HP LaserJet 1100A.  Wasted money. CyberHome = Worst quality products. Email CyberHome three times. No response. They don't support their products. This is a cool and groovy program.  I have had no problems instaling it or running it on my PC Drake Locke I connected this unit and usedit for a 2 weeks. Then I took a trip of 550 miles round trip.With my vehicle set on cruise at 72 MPH the gauge was showing miles per gallon of from 8 to 14. When arriving I filled up and computed the MPG using the trip gauge in my car and I averaged 36MPG.  The same happened on the return trip. BAAD NEWS FOR ME>>>> It worked fine for about a year. Then it started tweaking like crazy. Every once in a while, I'd have to reset the player because it would randomly act up in the middle of a song. By act up, I mean it starts making this weird loud tone that can't be stopped unless you reset the player. I suffer from allergies and sinus headaches and once I started using this product, the headaches I woke up with every morning have almost disappeared. This item was purchased as a gift for my son. He is a college student and was delighted to receive it. took 850 shots in spain.  then card fails. am unable to retrieve any images.  seagate says: "too bad." grrr.. I received the bundle but there is no installation key for Shade LE. I noticed the someone else's review stating this same problem is no longer visible so I figured I'd post it again. Tried it on two cars and, as a check, three in-house stereo systems. Waste of time and effort. This machine worked only for about 3 months.  I wanted to copy my VHS collection of movies onto DVD so I could dispose of the VHS tapes as players are becoming very scarce.  It is now useless.  It cannot dub or burn anything to DVD.  I wasted my money, don't do the same. This machine worked only for about 3 months.  I wanted to copy my VHS collection of movies onto DVD so I could dispose of the VHS tapes as players are becoming very scarce.  It is now useless.  It cannot dub or burn anything to DVD.  I wasted my money, don't do the same. After figuring out how to navigate the program, I am starting to organize all my recipes in one place.  Since I have stuff all over this is going to be very helpful. I'm having some major issues with the keyboard. The latest bios doesn't fix a thing.Problem shutting down and launching programs on the machine. Stay away I was lured to this product by a rebate which made it free. The manufacturer Computer Associates burned me for the rebate and will likely do it to you too. As for how it works no trouble installing like others have mentioned but it slows my computer to a crawl. After a while you will shut it down and then you can resume surfing the net at normal speed. I tried Dlink and Zyxtel or whatever it's called and they were both crap. This one worked exactly as expected. My son wanted it, so we did the research, and we bought it.  He loves it!  He uses it all the time to download songs from freinds and relatives and the internet. I wish they had these when I was his age (13), it would have saved me a lot of money on albums and cassettes! It's an awsome sounding product, believe me. I wish to by it but for some stupid reason they won't ship it to me internationally. It's an awsome sounding product, believe me. I wish to by it but for some stupid reason they won't ship it to me internationally. Connected to a D-link WBR 1310 it did NOTHING.  A field strength meter show no difference in signal at 25 feet. Bought a GT5032 and got a replacement for it because the TV tuner was faulty out of the box.  The replacement was faulty too.  The TV tuner is the ATI Theater 550 Pro TV Tuner.  Techs worked on both,  including downloading software from ATI but the TV picture continued to skip/stutter and eventually it would freeze after about 30 minutes.  I'm returning the second one for a refund. I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He loves it! Price was better than all retail stores and it was delivered in just 2 days. The scanner came in about 4-5 days before the actual expectation date, and the installation was simple as pie. Within minutes, I had the scanner hooked up, and was scanning images into my computer.  Thank you Cannon! I am loving this iPod...since getting it, i have over 1300 songs and not once an i having a problem with it.  I told all my friends where i got it.  Hopefully, they took my advice in buying it here. Very dissapointing.  The inexpensive foam of the ball just disintigrates in certain rims. I used HDtune 2.52 to measure the performance of a few SD cards. The Transend 1GB 80x was the fastest with 9.0MB/s transfer. I wish more companies would publish reasonable performance numbers. Just for comparison, the Sandisk Ultra II 1GB (which cost me more!) delivered 6.4 MB/sec. I tried it on both the middle and top floor of a three story townhouse.  It worked no better than rabbit ears.  Their tech support says that in brick houses it should be in the attic or on the roof.  Their adds don't mention that. I purchased this from Amazon, and installed it on my computer.  This package does not contain VB 2005 Express.  It has Web Developer 2005.  Will be returning it for refund. I installed this product and got it configured.  Everything was working properly, both on the LAN and over the Internet.  After a week, the device was no longer visible on the network (LAN nor Internet).  The D-Link configuration program could not see it on the LAN, it could not be pinged, and following the instructions to reset the device and restore the factory defaults did not resolve the problem.  D-Link's support, which is based in India, was not helpful and could not understand that the camera was physically 3,000 miles away from where I was. not very impressed by this product...got songs onto the player but within 5 minutes of putting them on they slowly start disappearing from the player. Life is too short because it is only 17 minutes at a time for 5 hours of charging. Lights up my entire street at night though. VERY POWERFUL I have found while driving it gives out of the way directions. when i know for a fact there are better routes and quicker ways to the destination. This sometimes prevents my PC from shutting down and I have to unlpug it. Otherwise it seems to be as expected. It's a water filter.  It does what it is supposed to do.  I have no complains. What can I say, it works as advertised.  I'm utilizing the unit in my Cingular/HTC 8125 PDA & it's making all the difference. Este aparato realmente ayuda a oir tu musica sin contratiempos ni interferencias como otros, realmente es muy recomendable porque ademas de tener tu musica en tu stereo ayuda a tu ipod a que no descargue nunca, ideal para cualquier viaje o para la ciudad. Simplemente perfecto!! I have installed, uninstalled, reinstalled more than 6x - closed windows' every foundation program upon recommendation - reinstated everything - communicated with symantec at least a dozen times - and today I found the cure to all Norton problems, it's called McAfee. 2nd time using one of these, bought it for my daughter, it lasted for about 3 hours then froze up.  No more Sandisk MP3 players for me. Not the quickest card out there, but it gets the job done and is reliable. This router was purchased for our Community center. I immediately installed DD-WRT firmware. The router covers the whole building which formerly was a one story four room rural school with a gym. It has been in operation for about a month with out any problems. It is setup with remote web administration to avoid a trip to the building to check on it. I have used this in the mountains, on the bike trail and on the road and am very impressed with it. El pen drive es de buena calidad, practico y facil de manejar, la velocidad de lectura y escritura es excelente. Recomiendo este producto Product does work as advertised. The only problem is that when I received it the threads were missing on one of the cable connectors. How can this happen? Isn't the product tested before it goes out the door? There is no excuse for poor quality. It does the job for a PC. Picture is sharp. But for hooking it up to satellite or cable, the picture is greating lacking in quality. 99$? I found this same item on Radio Shack for 13$ The SAME EXACT ITEM! All it is is an LCD screen that receives radio signals that are transferred into icons. It is updated every 15 minutes and finds your location. Very neat item - for 13$ 99$ would be another story. This is an amazing keyboard for the money.  Tone is exceptionally beautiful and there are lots of bells and whistles.  Only one drawback is the readability of the display box. Purchased this kit for a 06 Ford Escape, after installing it the radio comes up with no sat. Called TERK of Audiovox, they no it doesn't work with late 05 and 06 models but don't have any solution to problem. The picture is the same as the NW-E507 (it looks silver). But I thought the NW-E407 was black only. THEY BREAK AFTER 2-3 WEEKS, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE AND THEY WONT STAND BY THEIR WARRANTY. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! I ignored the terrible reviews and bought the arm band because I wanted it for running. I only used it once and it ripped on one side. I should have thrown my money away and duct taped the player to my arm. I will be sending the ruined product, along with my receipt to Sony and asking for a refund. I can't believe such a trusted brand would produce such a piece of garbage. This is a genuine Honeywell filter designed to be used with the 11 gallon Honeywell QuietCare Humidifier (Model HCM-6013i). It's just perfect. The box reports that this filter is compatible with the following humidifiers: Honeywell series HCM-6000 Holmes series HM3500 and HM3600 Claims On Box: Removes Minerals and Pollutants from Water Has Protec Microbial Treatment to help prevent the growth and migration of mold, fungus, algae and bacteria on filter. Helps capture dirt, dust and pollen. Reinforced for maximum efficiency and longer filter life. Exclusive Dry Lift Handle. Bought this for $35 at Fry's.  Kept it on my keychain in my pocket.   Within two weeks half the finish had rubbed off the casing and then the ring on the end snapped off.  What a waste.  Trying a Cruzer titanium next. Everything works as described.  Shipped when it was supposed to.  Wish everything was that efficient! We have the Safari (older) version of this toy.  Our son absolutely adores it!  He's grown from exploring the toys to bouncing away as he's grown taller.  The only thing that makes us sad is that he'll grown out of it very soon. this antenna exceeds expectations. i have a mountain cabin 75 miles from the largest city...i pick up all their channels plus a number of channels 95 miles away...yes the view is unobstructed but i was hoping for 5 channels...i got 20... Deborah, check out Logitech's website.  There's a left-handed version of this very mouse. I bought this clock radio as a birthday gift for my grandaughter. She loves it. Bought this MP-3 player for my son's 11th birthday.  Holds plenty of songs for a young music listener--and it picks up tons of radio stations. Not bad at all.  I was scared by provious reviews, one in particular, but i got the TV and it wasnt as bad. I bought it for my office and now its my favourite camping companion. Not bad at all.

Like some of the other reviewers, my Toshiba D-R4 will not finalize a DVD-R disk (very frustrating after 2 hours of recording).  To add to the insult, the disk drawer mechanism has jammed with the latest non-finalized disk stuck within.  This is how it will be returned... There's nothing to complain about the genuine ink cartridge. You could refill it with the refill ink, just do it before the genuine ink exhausts. for those of you in urban areas, this may not be ideal, but I believe that this difficulty would be found with any transmitter. However, on my way down to school this is ideal nd works wonderfully. The item was shipped promptly, although the clip art was terrible. The item was shipped promptly, although the clip art was terrible. This replaces an over-the waste basket shredder which had constant problems.  This one is worry free.  It doesn't whine.  You can carry a conversation (in person, not over the phone), while shredding.  A thing of beauty is a joy forever, so is a shredder that isn't loud and works. i bought this primarily for the D battery.  and charging time is not a problem for me. it works as it says. i bought this primarily for the D battery.  and charging time is not a problem for me. it works as it says. Don't waste your money.  I purchased this product. tried all the FM stations indicated & nothing but a hum along with the music.  Sorry, but this is GARBAGE. I own a 256mb cruzer mini and I just bought the 2 gb I tried recording the same file on both drives and it takes 5 times more on the 2 gb than on the 256... I'm very disapointed... I bought this player in Feburary '07 and it stopped working after 3 months. What makes it worse is, the player has been having this problem for some time and Sandisk did nothing to warn the users (to upgrade the firmware). I'm going to stay away from Sandisk products. I bought this mp3 player. After I downloaded the music, I realized this song downloaded wrong. I went to delete it, and  I could not delete the song. After a few minutes of trying to delete it, all the songs, but one, were erased from my mp3 player. Avoid RCA DirecTV products like the plague.  We bought a 3-room system and in just under a year one of the receivers died.  On the advice of their customer service (who blamed the problem on DirecTV software) we waited to see if the problem cleared up.  Then they told us it was out of warranty when we later asked for a replacement!  RCA is junk and their service is arrogant and dishonorable. Had a Hughes system previously - worked flawlessly and had better guide and interfaces. The speakerphone on this unit is terrible.  The phone appears to interpret ambient noise to mean the user is speaking, thus muting the caller on speaker.  The end result is that you can barely understand anything the caller is saying, as the beginning and ending of every phrase is clipped off.  Stay away from this phone. The Panasonic TH-50PX60U is out, and is selling for the exact same price as this, and is better in every way. The bag was not what I was expecting, and, furthermore, the retailer SUCKS in terms of their return policy. Works as advertised! Had 0-1 bars before. Now, 4-5 throughout a single level 1500 sq ft house. Antenna placement and base station placement is critical. Had found the ideal locations within one hour... I was sick of sending spreadsheets and tables to clients and them always telling me they have received them in some gibberish language because we don't have the same application version. I noticed Adobe's asking price and could not believe it! Someone mentioned Nitro PDF to me so after a quick Google, I found this gem. It's awesome for turning my spreadsheets into PDF and now no-one asks me to resend them. Frustration subsided for $100! The material is soft and warm, and very roomy. The delivery was on time. No complaints. Upgrading to a system that had no Centronics Interface was a bummer.  Then I went to Amazon and found this cable. It was 1/3rd the price of all the others that I saw AND with PRIME shipping it was a REAL bargin. John in Chapel Hill, NC Amigos tugas!!! Comprei um ipod video 30G no amazon e correu tudo ?s mil maravilhas, desde a simplicidade de compra, ao cumprimento dos prazos de entrega. Tive uma pequena ajuda...um amigo que vive nos estates recebeu a minha encomenda e trouxe-a para Portugal (obrigado Diogo). O pre?o ? muitissimo competitivo (bem mais barato que c?) e o material chegou em perfeitas condi?oes. Um abra?o a todos e ...bom som!!! Maybe its mainly the moaners who review these products.  Mine is superb.  Thought there was a fault. Rang UK supplier.  Software suggestions from him. Rang Garmin (UK) - Solved in seconds. Cant tell from the moaners but I wonder if they are UK or USA. I haven't got a complaint.  It is marvellous and improved my solitary training no end. it was not working .. I think problem with the antena . May be I was unlucky .. Sent the product bak Just a quick note how deeply dissapointed we were with the pictures after returning from our holidays, for which we bought the camera. Using only full automatic mode, pictures taken on sunny days outdoors were TERRIBLY, AWFULLY PALE. They were so bad that only a few could be rescued by computer software, by adjusting contrast. Most, 90% were wasted. VERY VERY VERY dissapointed. Just a quick note how deeply dissapointed we were with the pictures after returning from our holidays, for which we bought the camera.

The product was advertised as a 6-foot cable, but it is only a 5-foot cable. Oddly enough, the packaging neither mentions its length nor its brand name. The shortness of the cable made my equipment setup more inconvenient than it should have been. The beloved WRT54GS now runs VxWorks firmware and no longer supports Linux firmware as of revision 5. The WRT54GL is essentially a WRT54GS revision 3 that Linksys released to appease the niche market of people who liked using the DD-WRT and OpenWRT unofficial Linux firmware. If you are looking for a WRT54G(S) to reflash with the unofficial firmware, this WRT54GL is the model that you want. I bought this bib for my son after cleaning up dropped peas, carrots, and pasta from the cracks and crevasses of his highchair for the 1000th time.  This bib is a miracle!  Practically all of the dropped food (and with us, there is a lot of dropped food) is caught in the pocket which makes clean-up a snap.  The bib can be easily sponged off for quick cleans and tossed in the dishwasher or washing machine for more thorough cleaning.  The only member in our family who does not like this bib is our dog, who no longer gets a feast of dropped food. Hi, I have had this camera for a week and it totally rocks. [...] Thank you! p.s. this camera is smoking HOT A fine printer- if you don't mind constantly standing over it and sheperding each page of paper into the machine. The automatic feeding works very poorly. this is the second neurosmith jumbo music block i have purchased for grandchildren. i have recommended it to my sister for her grandchild.quality made and educational. everyone loves it. I purchased this item for someone that does not live here. I haven't seen it but they are satisfied with it. A nifty product for a student such as myself who finds themselves in their Cisco course without a handy-dandy crossover cable for those like device connections. Very useful tool. Only problem was the cost of shipping greatly exceded the cost of two of the adapters and it is terribly slow!! (14 days!) There are none in stock, and if you have ordered delivery is a gamble. My advice, if you have (as I did) an emergency, try a different product. Strictly speaking I have awarded 1 star for non delivery, so I have no comments on the product. Garmin has released Training Mgr for Macintosh as of Feb 2007. Works on intel and non-intel macs running OSX. I wish it was cheaper!!! Had trouble with 3rd party inks though... Things I wish were better with the MF5770: 1.) A seperate tray for Letter and Legal Paper. 2.) The error setting and requirement to change paper if a Legal document is sent to the printer when it is configured for Letter leaving the printer useless until you reconfigure it and change paper. A real pain. The rest of the functions of the MF5770 seem to function as advertized. ESTE ES BUENO PORQUE ES pLUG AND pLAY Y PARA PASAR VIDEOS Y FOTOS CON SU SOFTWARE QUE SE PUEDE BAJAR DESDE SU SITIO WEB ES FACIL, DEBES TENER EN CUENTA DE POSEER LOS MP3 CON BUENO idTAGS PARA QUE QUE LOS PUEDA ORGANIZAR ES BUENO !!!! OK for a gag gift and a few minutes of entertainment, but not if you paid more than $2 for them. I paid $12. Not worth it. I wish they had mentioned in the info that the headphones are the silly ones that hook over your ears.....bought it for a child and I would have chosen differently. I've been using it for a few months now and I haven't had any problems.  The safety features are a plus.  I like knowing it can't start up if the dogs knock over the can.  I do wish it cut the paper into shorter strips but that's about it. There is nothing more satisfying than a child smile and laugh. That's what the exersaucer made for both of my sons. We brough it for my older son when he was 5 mounths old. We made him choose from all the one they had at Babies'R'Us. He took this one over all the other pricy ones. Don't hesitate ! As with other's reviews, the DVD player quit working after 12 months (just out of warranty).  MAGNAVOX has declined servicing or exchanging after warranty expiration eventhough I was expecting to pay for repair/exchange.  They have basically abandoned a poor product.  Looks like I'll be the one abandoning them in the future. Buying this item was a very smooth process and it was delivered within a few days of the order. Baby slides down when incline pad is inserted while removed baby's head is hitting the head board. whether I'm inserting 2 sheets or 10 sheets.  The product spends more time beeping than shredding.  It does nothing but beep.  Hard to feed and A total piece of crap I was very pleased with the service from the vendor. The package arrived in a timely manner intact. The computer is everything I wanted it to be. Fellowes uses plastic gears in some of their shredders such as the P400C-2.  These will wear out (all the teeth broke off on mine) and they do not support replacement parts after 5 years. Now that my son is mobile, I had to move all my home theater components into a closed cabinet. Anyone who has a PS3 will tell you that the thing throws off a LOT of heat. Connecting these fans to the USB ports did the trick. Having the fans draw hot air out, lowers the inside temp considerably. One minor "Con" is that they can be a bit noisy when the speed is at max. Adjusting them to approx 80% makes them barley noticeable while a movie is paused and unnoticeable while the movie/ game is playing. This detector, and any other product from this manufacturer are very basic detectors with no scrambling capabilities whatsoever.  They are frauds.  Numerous independent research companies have determined that no added technology aside from detection technology exists within the casing of any of this company's products.  Stay clear. $15.98 for shipping on a $12.00 item and not eligible for bundling with other order as it's not sold by Amazon. Compro los productos Corsair porque se que son marcas que cuidan su calidad. Mi memoria USB reci?n adquirida funciona a la perfecci?n, incluye un cable colgante para colgarlo en mi cuello, muy buena adicci?n. I agree with the many other users who have experienced the "Condensation, Operation Paused" defect on their JVC GR-XXX. Despite numerous others reporting this problem, JVC says its not a recognized problem. I would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs. This is genuine Canon Ink.. Couldn't be better & cheaper in a two pack. i got this on october 30th and i used it for four months and the screen died on it.i would not reccommend it at all.a waste of money. The Backpack is exactly what I needed and it came very rapidly after I ordered it. It works for me. There's nothing magical about a DVD-R burner by now, and believe me, if ALL of Samsung's DVD-writers had the problems that the reviewer below claims, there would be a class action lawsuit by now. The folks at Computer Shopper UK gave the unit 4 stars. http://www.compshopper.co.uk/shopper/pcpro-labs/64858/samsung-tsh552.html I think this 16x samsung with dual layer capability is currently one of the better deals available on Amazon.com. Worked only two hours before locking up. Firmware or memory is bad. Act 2006 upgrade is an abomination.  I believe ACT 2006 will do for SAGE what Dbase IV did for Dbase.  I wrote extensively in the ACT 2006 product review before seeing there was a section for the upgrade.  I'm just placing this review here to direct you to the reviews for Act 2006. It is a touching story that follows in the tradition of Nightmare Before christmas. And that is saying something! I couldn't believe that Tim Burton would top himself! But he did. This movie has a voice all it's own and deserves to be seen. Nothing is more beautiful and tragically touching as a mistake in wedding arangements . . .especially to a corpse. this product is worthless for music.  for voice, it's alright.  and yes, i did turn the volume all the way up on the mp3 player. we used this for dental jeopardy at my dental school, it was awesome! everyone had a blast buzzing in and answering questions. The SmartDisk fotochute worked fine with Windows XP, but there is no driver for Windows Vista and the company has been sold so tech support is gone. CD player not very efficient; cannot select, have to start with CD 1 and it will continue to 2 and 3. I must have gotten a dud, because this thing only crackles and pops with intermittent audio.  The video reminds me of 1950's TV pictures--with broken tubes.  I am returning it.  Its a real piece of junk. I must have gotten a dud, because this thing only crackles and pops with intermittent audio.  The video reminds me of 1950's TV pictures--with broken tubes.  I am returning it.  Its a real piece of junk. My students and I are having a wonderful time playing Math Jeopardy with the Eggspert!!!  A+++! Received DVD's damaged due to inproper packaging by the vendor. Vendor refused to exchange damaged discs. While this may be an ideal choice for a single disc player, it was advertised as a "5-Disc Progressive Scan DVD Player".  Please be aware of this fact and if you are looking for a 5 disc player, this is not it. NIS 2005 caused me to have to reformat my hard drive and reinstall everything.  NIS 2006 was worse.  When it was partially functional, it slowed my computer to a 10 minute reboot and 45 seconds to open an email.  I worked on it for over 40 hours, uninstalling and reinstalling, trying every solution on their site including changing registry entries and three calls to their support staff.  I ended up with blue screens and had to download a special program from their site to remove it, under safe mode. I switched to ZASS and had it up and running on both computers in 15 minutes. Lots of the Olympus models are Mac compatible. I found lots of them on the MacMall website, plus reviews show that they are, including this one. This product is so attractive that when the 1st one I ordered broke within a week I did not learn my lesson.  Now the second one no longer works after 5 weeks----------I loved everything about it except it's very short lifespan! Not an item to be used with a pc for the tracking downloads.  had to remove Garmin software from pc, it kept locking my pc down! I am unable to rate this item yet as it a gift for a baby shower. The box that contains the item, is dented , ripped, and has magic marker writing all over it. The invoice was stuck to the box, hard to remove and left a sticky residue on the box.As it is a gift this makes an undesirable presentation.The seller should have placed this box in another box for shipping which would have prevented this problem. The product works fine and I had no trouble getting it from the vendor Super tare.Merge bestial cu Linux.Dar daca ai "norocul" sa uploadezi un firmware dubios e cam nasol. This antenna pays for itself in 1 month's savings of my cable bill and the picture quality is amazing! i would rate this item -10. your page does not indicate that there would be a charge of the $20 for the analysis of the exposed kit.amazon would not give me the phone no. of the company - only an email address-which was invalid. it seems to me that amazon is responsible for any item it advertises on its web page.how about a refund? S. F. Kudzin I ordered one and it won't mount my SD card on my MacBook Pro (10.4.7). Disk Utility shows it appearing and disappearing continuously. Don't bet on 100% compatability with this one. Although it says that this works for ALL versions of Photoshop it does not upgrade from Photoshop Elements.  I spoke with customer service and they would not give me the code to unlock it. I've had no problems with this card - it does seem very slow in the device I have it in but it could be it's the device that's slow rather than the card....  anyway, it's doing the job.  no frills.... We have had our system with 8 phones and chargers located throughout the house and garages  four years now.  Only problem we have had is lately we have had to replace batteries in some of the phones.  After four years, not a bad deal.  We are very happy with ours. The model # is indeed SBT-UPPC, although it does not say Sabrent. Upon inspection, I found the mini-CD  inbetween the cardboard insert sides. It could be missed  if you werent expecting a mini CD inside the insert...The cord alone measured 7 feet, not counting the connecting ends. The software was a pain, and now it's dead after just 4 times i used it. HP scanner is next for me, Canon made a hunk of trash. The product is slick in that it has a sliding compartment.  The biggest problem is that this charger won't fully charge any battery more than 2500mAh.  And it doesn't state this anywhere on the package. I bought this piece of garbage for my mac. No instructions. No software. Only a promise that on a Mac OS9 and above it will work without drivers. It did not. My Mac (OS X) did not recognize it and there are no drivers / instructions / phone numbers to be found. AND it barely fits into the enclosure. Total trash. I bought this piece of garbage for my mac.

My Mac (OS X) did not recognize it and there are no drivers / instructions / phone numbers to be found. AND it barely fits into the enclosure. Total trash. Returned the product. I don't think this should be called a "Professional" Ice Crusher. It crushes ice the same way my GE Profile refrigerator ice dispenser does.  My blender crushes ice better than this product. This product is not compatible with Sony DSC F707. The memory stick adaptor doesn't do anything other than throwing error.Sandisk claims that it works with all memeory stick products with the given adapter is false and don't believe that. I searched the internet after buying and found this non-compatibility issue with C13:01 ERROR is universal.Beware before buying. It slows your computer down.  There is no advantages to having NSW that most home page services provide.  Programs can't load.  Unnecessary glitches.  Deletes all user information, but doesn't ask whether to delete it.  A TOTAL waste of money and time.  PASS!!! Putting together a thoughful slide shoe takes time and effort.  Such was so in my case and when assembling my show in ArcSoft DVD Slideshow, I was very impressed in how it was coming together....until I tried to burn it to a DVD....IT DID NOT WORK ! After several attempts, I went to ArcSoft's website and submitted my question, which of course, was answered by an automated service.  It told me that I was using an outdated version 1.1.1.111 and I should be using version 1.1.1.114, and gave me instructions on downloading the update.  These instructions were of no value.  I then tried to query them again; this time getting no answer. Needless to say, I won't be buying anymore of ArcSoft's products. I am not sure that this helped my situation. It appears that I have the same level of power and reception now as i has before installing the antenna. I have tried THREE different SB5120's and each has had to be returned under warranty. I noticed that they are now made in China (used to be made in Mexico).  Motorola is ditching their quality for profit - the bastids. I bought this item to replace one of my Hitachi 4GB MicroDrive cards that bit the dust. It writes and downloads FASTER than the MicroDrive, and has the benefit of having no moving parts and hence, more reliability. This is a huge waste of money... very boring... entertained my daughter for about two minutes... The program crashed during Setup. When I finally got it installed, it crashed my machine every night until I uninstalled it. after about one month, the product seems to be working as advertised.  it arrived with a broken car charger which was quickly replaced!  we were amazed at the useful information that the unit holds. I used this shredder for about a year and now it is broke (the inside plastic guide disintegrated). None of the advertised specs are accurate. It will not shred more than 2 psc of paper. It jams often & it is noisy. During this period I cut approximately 1000 pages, and paid for the shredder $60. This results in a cost of 6 cents per page!! This is the worst product, relative to it spec, I ever bought!! Got this for my Daughter who just had a baby and she needed this for the Changing table mattress and it is so soft . The baby loves it. Very very Soft Thank U Anita I hope the person reviewing above is joking because it is not a body hair removal wax, it is for automobiles. The high percentage of white carnuba which is what it is made with provides an intense luster to the car paint. Our office is in a house that was built approximately 1910.  That means it has real plaster, lots of metal in the walls and it is four stories.  Before getting this antenna I nearly went nuts trying to keep everyone connected to the wireless network.  After I attached this antenna to the router though (setup was a breeze, I unscrewed one of the original antennae then screwed the cable end of this one in its place-- three minutes tops), most of my problems cleared up.  The base is magnetic so it can double as a refrigerator magnet. Most people complain that the alarm clock is not always lit, but I am glad about that because I like my room dark. The only complaint that I have about this phone is that there is frequently static in the phone and changing channels does not correct the problem. Because of this I am looking for another phone. I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality and variety of voices in this modestly priced keyboard.  It's more than met my expectations, in terms of performance for making demo songs.  There's no confusing this product with a performance level instrument, but then again, why would you expect that at such a low price? I tried four amplified antennas with varying success.  The Terk HDTVa finally allowed me to receive those HD signals over the air with an indoor antenna.  A "significant" difference over the others. The product has performed exactly as I had hoped.  Delivery was expediant. I purchased this unit for my daughter and she couldn't be more pleased.  It adds a comfort level to her travels. This item was a gift, I ordered it shortly before Christmas, and it was shipped immediately and arrived in time-incredible service. My husband-an avid mountain biker, is very impressed with the product and the numerous functions it performs. The price and service could not be beat! I have used it for about 2 months with my Olympus camera. It takes 650 photos exactly, at 3.2 megapixels. writing a DVD in 5 minutes by using this 16x dvd-r. you can't beat that. I've found things on the back shelf of the pantry that I'd forgotten I had!  My husband has three of these lights in his boat, and the fact that they can be moved and "restuck" is a real bonus.

Weather radios that receive NOAA broadcasts pick up transmission on one channel.  The channel number does depend on what part of the country you are in.  DUH!  The alert feature may require a larger monetary investment but I would suggest if the weather looks gloomy outside, turn the thing on!

The alert feature may require a larger monetary investment but I would suggest if the weather looks gloomy outside, turn the thing on! I have used the Hallmark Card Studio software for 6 or 7 years and the 2006 version is superior to the 2004 version.  I like having fresh cards to choose from every year or two. The product is difficult to maneuver among functions but performs adequately once you are there. Makes me wish I had purchased an I-pod! I bought inexpensive headphones so when I cut the grass the ear phones don't fall out.  For what I paid it is 'ok.' This product saved my computer. All the previous bad reviews must have had problems with their computers prior to installing. Mine lasted a year, the alarm setup is very nonintuitive. For the money there should be something else better. I thought that earbud skullcandy headphone will be in my hears very comfortabe, and they are going to stay there. That was the reason, and I bought it. My hears are normal size. It won't stay in my hears, and it keep on dropping!!! I updated to Norton AntiVirus 2006 fron the Norton AntiVirus 2002 that came installed with my comnputer. I followed the installation instructions exactly,it installed without any problems. It is currently running on my computer without any problems. I would recomend Norton AntiVirus 2006. I have purchased two of these and both have ripped beyond usability.  Sony will not replace after 90 days. Short and sweet.  My dsm320 died.  My dsm520 died.  both just out of warranty. I was very disappointed to discover that my 8125's keyboard won't slide out with this cover in place.  Not terribly useful, is it? I have bought two of these in the last six months and both have completely stopped working. I am an electrical engineeer with 25 years of experience and can say with confidence that Mobiblu has a class 1 quality issue. I will be returning one to Mobiblu, but judging from the customer support feedback in the other reviews, I will not be holding my breath. This bouncer has all the bells and whistles you can ask for, however it requires an excessive amount of time to assemble. Unfortunately, the screws require a lot of manipulation in order to securely fasten in to the holes.  Furthermore, some of the screws do not fully enter the hole which is another drawback. The assembly of this product should be seamless and require minimal effort.  For the amount of time required to assemble, I would not have purchased this item if I would have known in advance. Please develop products that require minimal effort and time to assemble.  There has to be a easier and more efficient method to assemble a bouncer. Delivery was within timeframe (just in time for the Chicago Marathon training)... and I am completely satisfied with the performance of this equipment. Every avid outdoor runner should own one! The music sounded distant, like there was something between my ear and the music, as if I was listening to music with my ear to a door. It was just too irritating. My book's firewire port was recognized by a cardbus adapter (I-O gear), but a firewire express card (Startech-2 port ) did not recognize the drive. Any suggestions? Yes, a nightmare, you dream about, start and restart, install and uninstall for this abominable excuse for a piece of programmed software. Error messages, just a sample, LU1812, LU1803, LU1814, 9999.71, and the DELETE from their internet site, impossible..all their site requests relate to actions that just cannot be activated, remedial suggestions are not workable. It is, by far the winner of the Golden Fish Bone award for the STRESS ACTIVATOR 2006. Amazons review wont accept a zero rating. My reception strength doubled after I used the ~5 foot cable to move the antenna into another room and "tweeked" the orientation. This product did exactly what I needed. This component is in conjunction with the Intel Board, Ram, and SATA drive that is currently being used as a "headless system". Meets expectations for OS. Delivery was earlier than estimated. Ron This is the second M250 I have purchased. The product arrived promptly and in mint condition (although I did not think it was a refurbished model). I could have missed that in the description. In my opinion, this "made in China' unit and battery in this machine is a built in money-maker for M-Audio.   The warranty covers the unit for 1-year, but the terrible battery for 90 days.  Don't worry though, they offer a $75 battery replacement procedure.  A third of the cost of the unit!  Shame on you M-Audio!  Time to admit these batteries are worthless. THIS PRODUCT HAS LOTS OF SOFTWARE PROBLEMS.  IN ADDITION, THE U.S. MAPPING SOFTWARE THAT COST $88.00 DOES NOT COMPLETELY DOWNLOAD. I tried uploading some of my routes to one of the mapping software websites and got terrible mapping results.  Some parts of the route were off by over 1/4 mile.  Their routing of the GPS coordinates were nowhere near the roads that I actually ran on.  Has anyone else experienced this bad of a result with their mapping of their routes? I bought these for my Vonage service about 6 months ago.  I connected them behind my router, per their instructions, and was up and running within 10 minutes.  Since then, I've had one minor complaint that was fixed within minutes by Vonage (the time/date on the phone was not correct for my area code).  Otherwise, these phones work as advertised. I won't review Vonage, except to say that as a reasonably technically savvy person, I've had zero problems with the service in my year of being with them.  I have the $14.99 a month plan, and it all works just fine for me. If you have tons of gadgets (like me :-)), rechargeable batteries are a must have companion to them. This stand leaves the front center of the television unsupported. This has caused my Samsung HLR5667 to bow at the speaker bar after only a few months. If it continues to sag it could possibly cause damage to the internal components. You will have to put a wood or metal piece between the TV and the stand to support it which kills the looks of the stand TV combo. I drove from Minneapolis through Chicago, all the way to DC, and it worked flawlessly. It got me through the Chicago Loop without problems!! What more can I say! I am on my second child, neither of which would sleep through the night until I used these.  No more kicked off blankets.  Plus I dont have to worry about blankets in the crib. I bought this movie shortly after purchasing my PS3 and boy was I amazed at the level of detail!  You can see every stitch in the character's clothing, every hair on their head, and every color in the spectrum.  If you are a Tim Burton fan you will truly enjoy this film.  It has lots of funny zingers and catchy tunes.  I have a 40 inch 1080p LCD Samsung with HDMI connecting to my PS3.  It is so sweet! I had a problem with my Sunrocket VOIP and I read that someone had bought this modem and that it solved her problem.  I gave it a shot and guess what no more dropped calls.  Thank you Motorola!!!!!!!!!! Imaginative and expertly crafted.  Thank goodness we have someone like Tim Burton keeping this form of movie-making alive. I bought a Sansa 2gb MP3 player for my husband. He was surprised. He plays it all the time. He loves it. Mediocre tire gauge that quit working after 1 year.  Replaced the batteries to no effect.  Will attempt to return it to this company, but from other posts, it looks like nothing will happen as they seem unresponsive. I enjoyed this monitor thoroughly up until about a month ago (after having it for 13 months) when it started flickering.  I was convinced it was a cable or video card problem because after "jiggling things around" and a few power cycles it would work again.  Until now, where the monitor both flickers continuously and is very dim at its brightest level.  After doing some research it appers that the monitor has a common problem with a backlight circuit.  So no more Samsungs for me - and does anyone know if having bought it through Amazon whether its in warranty or not?  I've owned the monitor for about 14 months now. Dave in Virginia I have this in my toyota corolla, and it sucks but my other car where the antenna is on side works perfect. So i guess it depends on what car you have. I received it struck of the opposite part (Display) and as I strayed the original packing I could not return it.  Did not mean but is a mess. I have a BEFSR41 dsl router and needed a wireless router to add to my network. I couldn't be happier with the WRT54GL. It has the same case as my BEFSR41 and they stack. Setup was a breeze and I am using my BEFSR41 as a switch. Everything works like a charm. It's a tale of the living & the dead coming together in holy matromony in Tim Burton's "Corpse Bride" In the gothic era of the 19th century in Europe a young man named Victor Van Dort inadvertally reserects a young woman while practing his vows & asumes he is her husband. It's a brilliant comical & romantic vision of the undead & the living, pure genius this film is. Featuring the voice talents of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gough & Christopher Lee. See Tim Burton's terrific movie of love between life & death This transmitter/charger works as advertised. The only 2 things I noticed with it is 1. There is some static in the strong treble parts (depending on the music) and 2. Finding a clear channel in your area. Any broadcast on the same frequency will cause some static I just got this a week ago. It comes with latest map software (v7). This map software is exactly the same as what mapquest.com uses. And I am disappointed by the accuracy of the maps. It got 3 of the addresses i entered wrong. I just got this a week ago. It comes with latest map software (v7).

I just purchased the GPS after researching and going to a local electronics store and found that the styling and features were just what I was looking for in a navigation system. I bought this for my 13 month old and she hated it and it dug into my collar bone. I am not a very tall person but my husband is a lot taller and he felt the smae way about it. I returned it 20 minutes  after buying it. The store salesman said that about 30-40% of them have been returned. Don't waste your money on this useless, overpriced product.  It does not contain Norton Anti-Virus so just pay your $29.99 to Symantec to renew your 2005 subscription.  When I opened the box and realized how utterly useless this product is, I returned it un-opened, only to be screwed out of $24.00 by Amazon for a "restocking" fee.  Please, learn from my mistakes. I couldn't ask for a product that did the job of supporting my 80 pound LCD HD DELL TV any better.  It's a beautifully engineered product. The arm is entirely adjustable and clears my desk area with a simple push. One defect that I noticed is the ratchet adjustable verticle swivel point is loose at the connection and there is no apparent way to tighten it. I was very please with the quick delivery and attention I received. These ink tanks are a pain in the neck to track down, no store sells them. Thanks for stocking them and for the price.Paula I would give it 'O'! stars if I could.  I had it less then a month, carried it home in my pocket from school one night with all  my school files so i wouldnt have to lug my laptop home thaat one night.  Tried to open it and had the same problem others have mentioned here.  If it is going to hve a rotating disk it should have a beefer housing to protect it. Be VERY careful when purchasing anything from Visioneer.  I own a visioneer One Touch 9220, and just learned they have NO intention of providing a driver for VISTA.  Not only that, I had to PAY to learn that.  Their corporate greed exceeds belief.  If you think you might, someday in the future, be upgrading your computer, I would have to suggest buying some other scanner Watch out for the power prong part.  It's made of very cheap plastic, after about a year the plastic piece fell out leaving only the 4 metal elements.  2 of the elements remained intact, but the metal elements on the other side got pushed in. Eggspert is fun. I was determined to learn history so I could win! Do not be caught with Marketing failures, This printer ships with a color ink cartridge only. The Black and white cartridge is optional....   Wake up HP    Are you going to Nickel and Dime your way out of the printer market.?? I bought the Lance Armstrong special edition in September 2005. Couple of months ago, my husband noticed a crack on the outside of the computer, right behind of one of the hinges  and immediately called the customer service. India picked up the phone and it took 45 minutes maybe more for them to understand what our problem was with the computer. Although we have a year warranty, this was for some reason not covered. We were upset so they said a technical support person will call and talk to us, which they did but my husband was not home so the tech.support guy left a phone number that is 24/7 busy. We called them again, this time very frustrated and they told us again they were gonna call and that was 3 months ago. So, be careful. We wasted our money!! N.Anderson hooked up the unit with my 3 sources and everything worked as advertised. No distortion in the video or audio. It has been all it was advertised to be... They could have sent along an Instruction Book, after a phone call to GARMIN they sent me one. Better instructins would have been helpful, The bottom covers were a bit of concern, peal off or what? In a short time "The ladies" voice became a bit 'garbled', Customer Support had me changee over to "The man's" voice. A needless phone call if an instruction book had been included. JRW There is a better product out in the market being sold by Fumoto engineering. It is self locking drain valve that replaces drain plug similar to Fram. For oil change, attached hose and turn the valve 1/4 turn. I am using on 2 vehicles for past 4 years with out any problem. This product was exactly what I needed for my phone LG VX8100 My husband was looking for a topo program for the Adirondacks.  Not exactly what he wanted.  Ended up returning the product.  Topography on this program is very basic. Oh, yes, I've got it:  JUNK!!! My T6420 stopped booting up. Emachines tech support said the motherboard was bad. This is 6 months after the 1 year warranty expired. They told me to call the Emachines replacement parts phone number. Emachines parts department said they do not offer a replacement motherboard. I listen to netcasts all the time and it is a real pain when I have to interrupt my listening for something. Whenever you turn the unit on it starts over from the beginning of the netcast. That's the only complaint I have with the unit, and unfortunately, listening to netcasts is the main reason I bought it. what can one say about a lens hood.  It fits the 100 400 zoom and it does it's job. Got this unit one day and returned the next.  Lots of static in car application, no matter which channel was used. The ink toner I received was exactly as described and was delivered in a timely fashion. Decent for the money, basic, no fancy stuff.  Not thrilled with scrolling wheel, but whatever~ I bought two for my kids and both got frozen in just couple of weeks. The solution provided by the technical support didn't help. send me the one without wire, exchange with restocking fee, i'm totally unhapy with it, is it my fault? Remote has out performed remote that cost alot more, it has repleced four remotes in one room and three in another The Teac is everything I hoped it would be.  No complaints -- suits my basic needs just fine. This mouse is cute and I didn't have problems with the tracking, but I stopped using it pretty quickly because it loses its connection to the computer constantly. I am using a Macbook Pro and have switched to the Apple bluetooth mouse which stays connected with no issues whatsoever. This divice freeses every now and then, it's not worth returning so i will just deal with it. In the product Description they said: "With an improved outdoor range of up to five miles". !! I think they should write : "With an improved outdoor range of up to five METERS". ---((VERY BAD DISTANCE))--- The controller works as advertised.  For situations where delay is acceptable, the self-timer on a D200 may be used instead of a remote controller to reduce camera movement when the shutter is released. If you fly hook into your i pod and cut out the plane noise, children and your seat mate. I bought this for my husband, who is a music fanatic, and he absolutely loves it!  He uses it in his car which has a jack.  He says it is fantastic! i was pleased with the product, only one thing i dont like about it is that it tends to just freeze up once in a while but thats it This is not the MSI VIDIA PLATINUM SLI BOaRD, it is the ULTRA board and has only one AGP slots and is overpriced by over $50 over the ultra boards from other vendors and the description misrepresents this model board.  I was dissapointed to received this board that will not support two sli graphic cards as that was the objective of my new system build for my teenager for xmas. This made a huge improvement to my wireless network.  I bought two.  I attached one to the wireless router and one to my computer in another room.  Prior to using this the performance of my Internet was terrible. I was only getting 2-3mb download speed, but now I am getting around 10-15mb (which is close to what I am paying for from my ISP. We bought this humidifier about 3 months ago because our bedroom was becoming so dry that we were waking with dry throats, bloody noses, and so on.  This machine has solved that problem and we have encountered no significant difficulties with it.  It is not too difficult to maintain, and the only problem in that area is locating filters in local stores, although Amazon and other online retailers carry them.  (I do wonder why the tank always leaks water at exactly the moment I move it over the machine, but not before; I can't figure it out but there must be a reason why this happens).  Re: Mold.  Apparently the person who complained of mold didn't realize the filters should be changed regularly, frequency depending upon the quality of your water supply. We purchased this MP3 player and before a year was up we had problems with it.  Sent it in to the manufacturer for repair (cost $25).  It worked for less than 30 days after repair.  Before we had any problems we recommended this product to a friend.  They bought an identical item, and it lasted less than 6 months before it stopped working. This is my third polar and probably last.  Bought this one in July 06 and it got condensation under the face and  then died.  Disappointing for having it only 9-10 months.  I rarely used it for water sports and it did this after working out on a hot, sunny day.  The same thing happened on the other two. I just received this today and within 2 minutes it was obvious I had made a mistake in purchasing this product. There are no instructions except for one poorly-written, nonsensical sentence on the back of the box. The tip of the gooseneck broke off when I tried to slide it into the back of the holder. And the holder itself broke while I was trying to adjust it to fit my iPhone. I'm now boxing up the pieces of this disaster and sending it back to the seller. If it were possible to rate this zero stars, I would! I just received this today and within 2 minutes it was obvious I had made a mistake in purchasing this product.

If it were possible to rate this zero stars, I would! According to Cnet review, "Microsoft stores your financial information on its servers, which some people may have an issue with." This was a deal killer for me. In this age of identity theft when sophisticated financial institutions are losing or exposing data to hackers or thru incompetence...there is just NO WAY any sane person should go along with this. Fortunately I can return it unopened so I'm only out the time and hassle. very dissapointed customer 1 order for 20 bottles of the above and only 6 recieved,another order of 30 ordered and none delivered The user interface needs getting used to, but otherwise it gets you to where you are going. No better than products such as Goddard's and Hagerty's as silver polish with tarnish inhibitors, but useful as an alternative to Brasso as brass, copper and pewter cleaner. Expensive. I recently purchased this antenna in hopes that it would improve the wireless connection for a desktop PC.  The PC has a D-Link PCI wireless adapter (DWL-G510).  Prior to installing this antenna, signal strength was 0-1 bars with frequent dropped packets and dropped connections.  After installing this antenna, signal strength improved to 1-2 bars with no dropped connections, though some packets are dropped occasionally.  In my opinion most of the improvement is due to the ability to relocate the antenna from the back of the PC to a better location. My only complaint is that the cable is a bit shorter than I would have liked. item was sent in a timely manner and my hubby is already using it and loving it. I spoke to Microsoft tech people before purchasing this item and was advised that it would do all that I wanted it to do for my company. When I received it, the program did NONE of the functions that I was quie specific about. I was very very disappointed. Additionally, the program is complex, "too busy" and the only user guide needs to be downloaded. Totally worthless program...I rate it a -5. I did however voice my dissatisfaction to Amazon and they have stood by their customer for which I am very appreciative of. We took a 200 mile trip just to test it before going 4,000 miles.  Worked like a charm! I don't know how this product compares to others in price or speed. All I know is I just retrieved it from my washer after it went through a cycle in the pocket of my jeans. I popped it into my laptop and it was as if nothing had happened! Impervious to water! Works just like it should.  Cheaper than buying OEM part.  No problems at all. I was always leary about ordering on line, Amzon has canged my mind about that. This item is everything that was stated and more. since this seller has HORRIBLE customer support... can someone tell me if the lenses require a 52mm adapter? thanks McAfee doesn't honor rebates as advertised. You can follow instructions to the tee and they denied the rebate for "missing" documentation that you did enclosed. Make copys of all documentation and then it's a roll of the dice whether you recieve the rebate. This was exactly what I was looking for...a bit of static which is alleviated wen finding another inbetween station. Purchased to expand amount of devices I could connect.  Works as it is suppose to. I got this product for my Dad who travels a lot and is about to retire.  He absolutely loves the Bose headphones! saved over $400.00 for the same exact product from Circuit City-- They wanted $649.00 plus tax- I ordered on Monday with super saving shipping for free and it showed up the very next day-- WOW-- Have 50" plasma and the bracket is sturdy and gets into any position needed> These and any other item like them are UNSAFE. When cars are crash tested by the manufacturer they are not tested with items like there. When you add these to the car it completely changes the dynamics of the seatbelt in a crash and can lead to SERIOUSE injury or worse to your child! I am soooo sorry I purchased this scanner.  All it did was totally mess up my Dell system.  I had to hire a computer technician to undo all the damage and hidden files, and drivers that this item came with.  I've used Visioneer before, with no problem.  This one was a lemon. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the scanning light could not be recalibrated. Vendor claims Amazon puts up the title and they match the product, so if Amazon sells "Brakes", only after the item arrives at your doorstep, will you read from the invoice that it was brakes for a Mercedes and not your BMW!!! The item is shipped as a HD15M, RCA-F/DIN4-F MATROX G450/  on the invoice ... If you don't have a Matrox G450, you are on the hook for your shipping charges back to them. My company is considering buying 170 of these Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router, I hope someone will send me an email so we can talk........ Thanks. Plalyer is wonderfull Region Free Capable of playing Region 1,2,3,4,5,6 PAL or NTSC -- There are two flex rod knobs that are attached to D shaped turning points as seen in the pic. Screw them down tight and there is plenty of movement in two planes ... easily following stars at higher mag. Due to the problems with delivery, the shipment did not reach me. I waited a week after the last date of delivery and emailed the vendor. They were very prompt is fully refunding me the whole amount, no questions asked. I would trust this vendor the next time I am buying online. I'm sick of adding broken printers to landfill, but I'm getting ready to toss this one into the dumpster after one year. The paper feed jams about 50% of the time, then it won't pick up paper. After 3 months I had to jury rig the back door so it would stay in place without turning the printer off ( there's something wrong with the switch there ). Stay away from this product! The program went in to several hangs while trying to install. I used Task Manager to proceed further. Once installed and all "Green" for ok, I tried using it. I teach college mathematics online, and am constantly opening and closing multiple student Word files. Norton Security slowed my Word to an absolute crawl so it became unuseable. I have to diasable Norton Security when working!!! I bought the device primarily to scan credit card receipts into QuickBooks.  Frankly I am very disappointed with the interface to QuickBooks.  While it scans and reads the receipts correctly in about 90%+ of the time, once it collects the information, getting that information into the correct Quickbooks accounts is just plainly too difficult to be practical.  Instead of giving one a menu of accounts to send the data, it wants to send all the receipts into a single account.  That would be fine for a home user putting all charges into a credit card, but it is not sufficient for a business user to have all receipts clumped into a single category. The pop up shade worked fine, but brock about nthe tenth time it was opened. The retractable cable allows me to keep the adapter in my cassette deck without having any dangling cords. My only minor annoyance is the clicking noise the adapter makes as it is running. Fortunately, the music drowns that out. This product is awesome.  Since I installed it there have been NO sperious advertisements Period The product works as advertised. The only problem I have with this is that the buckle is hard to undo when you are done with your workout. The treadmill recognizes the polar as I step on to it. Allows a hands free cardio or fat burn workout. I had been looking at prices and warrenties for MP3 players for a few weeks and happened upon this product online. I am very happy with the way it works. I don't notice a difference in quality as compared to the "name brand" one that my friend spent 150 dollars more on! Only got one noisy season (three months) out of a fifty dollar humidifier! That Stinks!  I've owned other models and got years out of them! NEVER AGAIN on this one!! This product is very stable. I plugged it and it worked like expected. No bugs. No problems. Upon receiving this router, I flashed it with DD-WRTv23. This is simply a spectacular router when combined with this firmware. For the price I paid from Amazon, I should have gotten 3 or 4 of them. With the price of the unit being lower than a year ago. It has become a valuable tool and lives up to the hype. Im taking it back today.  This thing is flimsy and cheaply built.  Its got a sliding drawer to extend the capacity of the charger...yeah, thats gonna be working in month. I am a serious S-bucks addict and since I have purchased my Bialetti Mukka Express, I am making S-bucks coffees at home.  My favorite, a vanilla latte is accomplished using their House blend ground for an expresso machine and a 1 oz. shot of their vanilla syrup.  I've made iced lattes too but not putting the milk in the Bialetti, but adding it to cold to 3 oz. of the coffee in a cup full of ice. I agree with others.  The only oops I have had is when I didn't screw on the top to the bottom properly.  I'd recommend the all stainless product.  My friend got the cute cow print and her oops have caused the paint to peel - not pretty! The ad copy for this product makes you think that it might be appropriate for a native English speaker learning Chinese.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  This is designed only for native Chinese speakers, and specifically those from Taiwan, and Hong Kong, as the included dictionary data will only input and output in traditional characters (versus simplified as used in Mainland China). Don't waste your money and frustration if English is your first language. This is the worst piece of software that I have ever owned (including shareware/freeware).  This is the 2nd product I have purchased by Griffin Technology (the other was the microphone for iPods). They have both been pieces of junk. This software is buggy, constantly crashed, diificult to add stations to record, etc.  Avoid this product. I compared prices on a under-the-counter mounting GE radio.Cheapest price was with Amazon.com because of they not charging for shipping. Now that it was ordered thru them, a shipping & handling charge was assessed @ $9.12. Product is delievered not functioning, has to be sent to the manufacture for warranty. Postage is $16.40. Could have bought locally @ Sears for less money & if it didn't work they would of replaced it at that store. Lesson learned! My husband is a construction superintendent, and uses a laptop on the job. This keyboard enables him to work more efficiently, and coffee spills and dirt don't phase it. Every guy that sees it wants one! I ordered two players. Each of them stopped working within 24 hours of taking them out of the box. After hitting the power button the player freezes on the initialization screen. The only button that will then work is the power on/off button. Don't waste your money, and more importantly, your time. Products do what they're supposed to for 10 cents on the dollar that you would pay at radio shack, circuit city, etc..... Although the 2007 version of this program is pictured and described, the ISBN and model number are for the 2006 version, which is what you will actually receive. The item meets all my needs/wants but one, WORKMENSHIP. When I opened the box containing the player I noticed two (2) screws were loose on the bottom. When I tried to tighten them I discoverd they were stripped. This does not seem to effect any functions and their are six (6) other screws holding it together. I plan on keeping the player as the options (all region and code free) far out-weigh the screw issue. Outstanding piece of equipment. No problems or complaints. Anyone who has issues with this device is probably way too picky. Excelente Camara Digital. Deberian incluir una tarjeta de memoria para completar el kit. La calidad de la Cam y sus infinitas funcionalidades. Software y accesorios completos. I loaded "Recover Lost Data - StompSoft ware" onto my healthy C:drive.  I wanted to recover data from a USB jumpdrive.  The software came with an instruction manual in pdf format on the CD.  When I attempted to access the instructions the computer continually shutdown and automatically restarted.  The technical support from StompSoft after 7 days had not responded to my service request.  It cost me $95 for a local IT person to reinstall WindowsXP and delete this software.   It took me an additional 5 hours to reinstall the rest of my software. Now I know why Kingstone it's the most famous one! I have no problems :) It's cheap and it works, but the actual product is not as pictured.  I bought it rather than some of the others here on Amazon because in the picture it has a coiled cord.  The actual product as delivered does not have a coiled cord. I've had my Brother MFC 8660DN for three days and up comes a "Fuser Error". Arggh.  Very expensive to replace.  Piece of Junk I agree with Khyraen 100% on this one. Completely childish and shows the hypocrisy of those who are supposely againsts spanking, and the baloney that they now need therapy! Imagine the outcry if someone made a simular "bumper sticker" about one of them. I have mentioned this before and I will say it again. This section is for REVIEWS. It is NOT a debate forum and it is NOT a place to launch personal attacks against those who share different views from you. Grow up! This is a horrable mp3 player, on the second or third time I tried to dowload music on it it froze up my computer and it did all of these wacky things to the mp3 player. I knew someone else and the same exact thing happened to them to, and it did not just happen to me just once but twice on two different mp3 players! I'm very disappointed with the CD player.  After only a month and a half of having it, it doesn't read the CDs.  Such as waste of money!!! Stay away from Thompson RCA products. They a junk and the customer service is worse!! This product that SanDisk markets is not compatible with Mac computers. The manufactor does not disclose the fact it is not compatible with a Mac computer, until you call for tech support at SanDisk. When asked how to resolve the problem is to return it or sell it to someone else. SanDisk is not accountable for the error and dismisses the customer to resolve their error. I give this product a ZERO because of the lack of integrity by the company. I purchased my copy directly from McAfee. In attempting to build a database to identify unnecessary files, it hangs the computer and QuickClean must be stopped using CTRL/ALT/Delete. I attempted to access support online and was informed that support was not available for this product. I located the support forum and posed a question, describing the problem. Nearly three weeks later, a McAfee rep replied with some suggestions that did not work. While I have been a satisfied McAfee Anti-Virus customer, my experience with QuickClean 6.0 is so disappointing that I don't think I would gamble on any other McAfee products. I had just put together a new computer, an AMD 64 X2 4800 with ASUS 8an SLI motherboard. The microsoft xp pro came with a 60 day trial version of Norton Internet Security. Four days before my trial version expired, Norton stopped updating virus definitions and any of the other stuff it does. At the same time my operating system started malfunctioning. It was not salvagable and only became worse. I ended up having to reformat. I have Norton Systemworks on my other computer. It was erased a bunch of my wife's files and I could not recover them. I will be changing software companies. Cursed Symantec for their crappy software. Purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife. She loves it, but finds it difficult to learn. I ordered two of these and one of them came missing several piecies so I had to assemble it with less shelves than the other one that came complete.  The shelves of are a very flimsy design using plastic side suports with no metal unless you plan on anchoring these to a wall the DvDs are going to fall off if you are not careful. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase.  I only wish I would have bought one sooner.  Using this on a Ford F350 diesel, my around town mileage has gone from 13.4mpg to over 17mpg, and my hiway mileage has gone from 15.3 to 23.1! The ScanGauge paid for itself after just four tanks of fuel, and now I'm saving money. We have business that provides payment choices for merchants.  We were trying to print labels from the large sheets when we just needed a few.  We ended up with wasted labels and jams in the printer. Bought this Dymo label printer and wish I had bought the Dual printer to have the address labels and postage labels loaded at the same time! I recently purchased a Canon Powershot S2 IS and a lens adapter for a UV lens.  I was looking for a camera bag which would accommodate the camera and lens adapter.  This bag fits the bill!  It appears to be a quality built bag. Okay, that may be stretching it but be aware that this program could cause major heartaches. It cost me about eight hours of my time. The company gave me no help.I am sorry to write a bad review. I uninstalled it and sooo wish I had not tried it. I received the clock as a gift from my now deceased grandmother so I won't toss it out but the number one, so the clock can show 10, 11 or 12, faded out almost immediately; the backlight is worthless and it rarely connects to the atomic clock to update the time. I guess it was worth the $12 she spent. I ordered this fan thinking it was white.  It is not.  It is mint green.  After receiving the fan, I contacted Supentown customer service.  It is Supentown's position that the ad clearly shows it to be green and nowhere in the ad does it say the fan is white.  Unbelievable!  How about nowhere does it say it's green?  Caveat emptor!!! Product arrived on time and was exactly what we ordered and needed.  No complaints! Plug it in and forget about it. I had an earlier version of the surfboard fail in service.  My line is rather noisy.  I noticed that the previous modem did a better job with my noisy line - synchronized faster and more often. Now that I have my line cleaned up, they're just about the same. My unit's battery compartment is one-eighth inch too short for the three rows of three C-batteries to fit inside.  Thus I have no battery but the crank-up one, and no TV at all.  Nobody else mentioned this problem, so I guess this isn't a design problem--perhaps I got a defectively-manufactured unit. I found no difference with the Kingston brand memory cards and the more expensive brands.  I have only owned this memory card for a several weeks; therefore, I cannot comment on the length of life of the card.  That's why I have only rated it with 4 stars.  But it's working like a 5 star product. She keeps using it daily and freaks if she doesnt have it so she must think its the bomb. I have used this in the Chicago and Los Angeles area, and it works very nicely. The key is the ability to select all frequencies on the FM dial, more helpful than the preprogrammed ones. Other brands have an occasional failure and the disk has to be thrown away and anything recorded has to be redone. But I haven't had any misses with these yet. Highest Price: $95.04 Lowest Price: $61.99 Average Price: $90.39 Tracking Since: January 25, 2008 1:27:51 AM PST I did a fair amount of shopping and comparing.  The price at Amazon and the performance of the Sharp TV are winning combinations.  The TV met all expectations. I did a fair amount of shopping and comparing.  The price at Amazon and the performance of the Sharp TV are winning combinations.  The TV met all expectations. I bought the camera for my trip to Palm Springs. The clarity of the pics...wonderful.The desert landscape was awe inspiring and this camera captured beautiful memories. I used it only for 2hours or so while driving and after a while, the green light was gone. No matter what I did, the power indicater was not turned on. I am not sure if it was broken while driving and it was too late to returned this product. Sorry it is only one star. If it was working fine, I would have given 4 stars. I purchased this mainly for my wife who loves her coffee.  It fits securely on the handle bars of the Bob Stroller.  It is made of very durable nylon/dupont cordura type material (webbing like material). The holder contains a zip pocket in the center for a cell phone, wallet, or other items of similar size.  I believe I have put my cell phone, keys, and wallet in the pocket with room to spare. There is a warning to not put too hot of a liquid container in the cup holders.  I imagine this is assuming the worst situation in which the cup holder would melt and/or the liquid would spill onto the child. We have had no problems with a travel type coffee mug that has a closable/lockable lid. An open type cup (no lid) with a hot beverage is just asking for trouble.

My daughter learned a lot of skills since her age 2 to count, listen and repeat dora stories as the stories are adventerous and simple for her to follow through each of them. This software edition is making her enjoying playing with it on computer This is the second one I have purchased (one for the wife) and both of them have been very reliable.  For the price, you can't beat it. I was looking for a better pair of earphones and this is not it. Bass was washed out. Performance is not worth the price. I ended up returning them because the performance was so bad. Worked only for a couple months (during which time it had to be inserted a few times to work properly) and then failed completely. Lost everything on it. Could not be formatted after that. For the money it is ok... but a simpler wrapping might be more handy for fitting in a pocket just to keep from scratching. I found it bulked up the tiny camera more than I wanted... so I wound up rarely using it. This product was purchased primarily for the CD player.  It was used a maximum of 30 times and then it quit.  The CD would not work despite the whirlling noise of the disc turning. A waste of money. Washington, DC I bought 4 of these fans to cool down my ps3 which is in a closed cabinet. I just installed them in the panel in the back and keeps my ps3 about 65 F degrees when running.  Without the fans it ran about 105 F. It's ok but comes with a bunch of crappy demos that can't be deleted unless you format the player using format function from windows. Should include a carrying case too The text above (on 1/8/06) states that this television has a 4000:1 contrast ratio. However, when reading both the Sharp product information at http://www.sharpusa.com/products/ModelLanding/0,1058,1586,00.html and the CNet review at http://reviews.cnet.com/Sharp_LC_26DA5U_LCD_TV_26/4507-6482_7-31530025.html?tag=nav, it would appear that this TV only has an 800:1 contrast ratio. Others shopping around for LCD TVs might want this information when making their decision. Of note, the Samsung LN-R268W 26" television (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009612GQ/) has a 3000:1 contrast ratio which appears to be the highest in this class of television.

Oh, the phone is all "la la la I love its range and clarity," as other users report, but my face hits the Mute button as I talk.  Unaware that my calls are muted, conversations break down into two kids with crappy walkie-talkies:  "Hello?  Hey, you there?  Hello?!" I don't suffer from Fat Face, nor am I mashing the handset to my cheek.  The phone is otherwise excellent. But I'm going to destroy mine. I purchased a Sony 5-disk CD changer in 1991 that could shuffle between all five disks. This model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time. What were they thinking? The ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs. a single disk CD/DVD player. THIS BABY IS GOING BACK! It is a cool thing.  The product was delivered in timely fashion. There was some initial trouble loading the software, but that may have been a function of our particular PDA.  The only complaint was that the instruction manual was not very helpful. Once loaded, the device works like a charm. Having read some of the other reviews here I recognize exactly the problem we had - the thing ran for maybe ten days and then the motor quit, forever.  Unlike other and wiser reviewers, we had already discarded the packaging materials so there's no returning it.  Money down the drain.  A worthless piece of junk... Ok - it's ink - it's black - it fits - it works.  How exciting can this review be. I bought two and they have proven to be very useful in saving documents and pictures. Amazon says it is, Spectec say's it's not. 'nuff said. The disc comes with PC Only drivers for the Windows Mobile versions mentioned, but nothing for Palm. 1. This worked for me and transmitted forty feet, but only after I attached a spool of copper wire to the antenna, after prying open the case. I had to adjust the wire till reception cleared. Otherwise it was static. Before the copper wire, I had static in an FM receiver one foot from the Griffin Rocket antenna. 2. If you have a wireless router, the transmission from the Griffin Rocket may interfere with the router's transmission. I only know the router does not drop connections when I turn off the antenna. I loved this car seat for my son.  It's safe and durable.  It is, however, very heavy.  I got used to it so it wasn't a problem.  If you are going to be carrying your carrier with your baby in it on your arm, then be prepared for the weight. I got it a few years ago and just HATED it. It did not blow ANYTHING! And two of the blades looked like they were falling off! When it works it's features are fun and interactive.  Technically, it is very weak.  It has a lot of quirks when exchanging information between the device and computer.  When downloading from the device to the computer the device will beep appropriately and give a report confirming data transfer.  However, the computer side will report that it cannot communicate with the device.  After several blind repeats the computer side will generally "spontaneously" eventually accept the data.  The bad news is that repeating the transfer process risks "frying" the device and making it inoperable.  Very frustrating. Shipping and handling cost me $44 dollars. This only gets this to your curbside and not into your apartment. This was for my disabled uncle who cannot move a 100 lb tv. There are NO steps up to the Elevatored apartment building, but they shipper still wouldn't do it. Contacted Tech Depot and they said it was their standard procedure, but no where on Amazon does it state CURBSIDE shipping only.  I filed a claim against Office Depot which is still pending. I ended up paying the shipper (Pilot Air) $25 cash to bring the TV up. Very unfair practice and Office Depot needs to state this CLEARLY on all of their items that they are selling. I bought this unit at the beginning of the winter season after retiring my older, smaller Honeywell units.  I wish I hadn't gotten rid of those smaller guys though because this one has some design flaws and isn't holding up. My two major complaints are that when the tank is upside down filling, there's not handle to then lift it out of the sink or tub.  First you have to cap it and then flip it and drip water all the way back to the unit.  My older one had a handle on both ends.  Secondly, there's now indicator to tell you when the tanks are empty. Lastly, one of my tanks already has a number of cracks in it and I'm afraid it will start leaking.  I expected this unit to last at least a few winters, not 1/2 of one. arrive on time, and it was 15 $ cheaper than any other store This product works perfectly.  It tilts and swivels and is inexpensive.  I had it out of the box mounted with the tv on it in minutes. Installed it yesterday, and I couldn't ask for anything better.  Everything works just fine.  I bought it for the radio feature more than the CD player, but other than the fact that the AM stations don't come in, which is more of a location problem of course, everything works just as it should.  I guess I got lucky. This program claims that it works on Mac OS X, but it does not.  The company has not responded to our messages, so do not expect tech support if you have problems.  We researched the product & system requirements carefully before ordering and are disappointed that we have no idea how the program actually is.  Beware of false advertising by JumpStart. It's frozen, won't turn off without taking the battery out, won't respond to any buttons or being plugged into the computer, computer won't recognize it as a flash disk, can't update the firmware, nothing. I called Sandisk support and did everything they could think of, nothing. I've used Adobe products for years and years and will continue to do so. I had to return this product. I have a newer G5 iMac with all OS X updates and as a program it worked. But if you buying this for a sreensaver, like I did, the product didn't work. I tried emailing and posted a question on Allume forum, got no response. I have bought three of these puppies, one for DVDs and two for CDs and they give you the maximum storage with the minimum space for a reasonable cost. Takes about 40 min to assemble. My daughter in law wanted a battery charger for Christmas. After researching online I found the exact charger that she wanted and she loves this.

After the install finished it asked for a reboot. Live update ran. Everything works. No complaints. THE CASSETTE PLAYER DOES NOT WORK.IT PLAYS CD'S BUT NO CASSETTE AND WHEN I TRIED TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE ABOUT THIS THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER,JUST A EMAIL CONTACT. I bought this and I have used this to plastic weld for a while now. It is very portable and can be used in used in tight space. I have gotten 30 hours out of one propane cylinder. This is awful like within 2 weeks it started to develop problems now its just frozen on me its bad I purchased 6 of these memory cards for a trip to Asia.  They worked perfectly.  I didn't have any problems with data loss or card failures.  I suggest SanDisk for all your memory card uses.  They are very reliable. En realidad no me parece un producto que valga la pena. Tienes que tener el iPod encima del radio para que puedas escuchar bien la Musica. No lo volveria a comprar. OCR, with this program, simply does not work with our hardware. The program crashes. We have the latest version that just came in the mail. What a waste of money. Hardware tested with this software: Powerbook 15" 1.5 GHz G4, OS X 10.4.8, 2 GB of RAM.

Upgrading two Pentium 4 computers from Norton Internet Security 2005 to Norton Internet Security 2005 AntiSpyware Edition resulted in the loss of Internet browsing capabilities on both machines. Suggested solutions on the Symantec web site were of no assistance. These machines had run earlier versions of Norton Internet Security without any problems. E-mail access works but internet browsing, whether through IE or Firefox, is disabled. Turning off Internet Security does not restore browsing capability, the computer must be rebooted with Internet Security disabled in order to browse the Internet. Live technical support is provided only on a charge per call basis. Overall I'm very satisfied with this product. It provides more accurate data then my "dumbed downed" car manufacturer-provided gauges. Though I did have a problem with the OBD-II data cable provided with this product. The cable would not connect to my car's connector and I called the vendor regarding my problem and the only advice they could provide me was to "sand down the outside portion of the cable connector housing and it will eventually fit". Wow, that's scary. Fortunately I didn't take that route but rather I took a more scientific approach to the problem and determined that the plastic "tab" that is a part of the cable connector protrudes slightly from the connector shell so I scarred it several times with a box cutter and snapped it off. And that did the trick! The DOT-it did not stick under my kitchen cabinet, nor on the wall of my closet.  The light was a blue tint and "cold".  I had ordered 3.  I returned 2 un-opened packages.

The loop at the top of the pack tore while I was bringing my gear from the car to the house. Fortunately, true disaster was avoided when the camera bag with my camera landed on the car seat. This performance is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE for a backpack. I hope the vendors performance is better when I attempt to return the product. CHEAP HEADPHONES, IF YOUR LOOKING FOR NOISE CANCELING HEADPHONE WHIT BASS THIS IS NO THE HEADPHONE FOR YOU............... I've had this unit for over a year, and I'm very pleased with it. My only complaint is that when I kept it on once for a few days straight, using its tuner instead of my TV tuner, it stopped working altogether. It was okay when I turned it on the next day. I've found that if I keep it on only when I'm actively watching a DVD or a VHS, then turn it off afterwards, everything's fine with it. The MP3 Player is not a bad deal for about $53. It is everything I expected it to be, except it drains batteries like there is no tomorrow. A Triple A Duracell will only last approximately 3 1/2 hours. Within a few weeks, I started having problems with radio reception and would have to fool with the antennae repeatedly during the day.  Sometimes CDs would play and sometimes they wouldn't.  Now, less than a year after buying it, it's stopped working altogether.  Don't waste your money. The tank design is such that it does not stand in the tub for filling and it is awkward to hold and slippery to manipulate.  It slipped, dropped about 4 inches and cracked. Now it is useless.  The tank needs work. I was a big fan of version 5 so I upgraded to version 6 without hesitation.  Unfortuantely some of the "optimization" tools do anything but optimize your computer.  In my case it appears to have disabled crucial software start-ups and deleted important registry entries.  And although the manufacturer claims that these changes can be undone, they cannot. I purchased this cable modem to avoid paying $3/month rental for a Cable modem from Comcast.  They had originally supplied me with a surfboard, so I expected this to work.  No end of dropped signals - usually losing 3-5 hrs of internet access daily.  Finally, Comcast came out and gave me another rental - this time an RCA, and that was the end of my problems.  Except I'm paying Comcast to rent a modem again...  So this modem turned out to be less than useful, and a waste of my money. I bought this based on my experiences with linksys products, but this is a piece of junk.  It only works with activex with internet explorer, and only works over the internet with linksys' ddns service (free for ninety days and after that you pay for the life of the product).  Doesn't work with IE7.  Very sorry I bought it. The noise cancellation system produces a lot more hiss than I expected. For quiet passages of classical music, the headphones produced more noise than they canceled. I tried some more expensive Sennheisers at a store, and there was no detectable hiss. The dimensions listed on this device are incorrect. I ordered this item because I have a shallow space and because the depth listed is 9.5 inches. However, according to the manufacturer's web site, the device is actually 13 inches deep. [...] I ordered this item thinking it would be plain ivory for my daughter.  When I received it the blanket was white with blue trim.  I wish the pictures or descriptions would describe the item better next time!!!!!!!!!!! Este reproductor de mp3 es muy bueno si lo que te interesa es tener memoria disponible y ejercitarte.  El precio es bastante accesible y definitivamente es mas fuerte que el Ipod shuffle. Milward (Panama, Central America) I have had a difficult time getting various computers to recognize it in the USB. Then the screen went out and so they sent me another one. The display stopped working on that one to but by then it had been 90 days so no returns. I bought this camera 14 months ago. I have had issues with it locking up which is annoying. Then one day I got a red screen and a 000000018-4489-957-000 error message. After researching, contacting HP and visiting discussion boards, I discovered it was a hardware problem. The long and the short of it is, once the hardware fails, the camera is done!  It will cost you around $150+ to fix it and HP thinks you should pay that after spending $250+ for the camera. Of course HP believes that 14 months is a reasonable amount of time to not make them liable for the junk they are manufacturing in China. It is clearly a manufacturing defect! Search the message boards and you will read about the frustrations of others with the hardware failure problem. Don't waste your money on the Photosmart line of products. I am going to stick with the traditional photo equipment manufacturers in the future. *****DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE PHOTOSMART LINE OF PRODUCTS.***** I've been using this Kingston drive for three months with complete satisfaction. Can't believe it only cost $10.00 for 1 gig. The screen is fantastic. I would have given it a 5, but unfortunately, it malfunctioned just 2 days after very slight usage :( That is a shame. I am so unhappy :(   :(   :( I too thought a built-in DVD was agood idea. I may have played 6 movies before the player quit.It sucks it in then ejects it as quickly.I got no help from magnavox other than paying $250 for another unit. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.Never buying anything Magnavox or phillips. We had this product for only 4 months.  The on/off button broke after a month and then the screen broke on month four.  Called customer service and was given the run around.  In the end, we were told the warranty didnt cover the problems we had, and they could sell us a refurbished unit for 50% off. Since I didn't know anything about installing a wireless router, I waited for my family on Thanksgiving for help.  With the help of family, the installation took us no longer than 20 minutes.  No problems either. This bag fits all my travel needs for my computer and all the accessories. Plenty of space for the computer, accessories, books and other travel needs. Very durable. Solidly made and constructed. My kids loved this movie. And your kids will love it too, if they liked the Christmas movie Nightmare before Christmas. This movie starts off alittle dark, but the kids forget about all the bones & ghosts as the movie goes along. I bought this receiver over 2 years ago and have sent it back to JVC 4 times. Except for the time that it wouldn't turn on at all, JVC denied that there is any problem. The unit shuts down sporadically with any minor blip in volume whether from a dvd, xbox or tv. I finally told them not to return it and bought an Onkyo receiver which was cheaper, has 4 HDMI inputs, and sounds wonderful. I obviously got a lemon, but what infuriated me was JVC's denial that there was a problem with the unit and refusal to replace it. I wasted a lot of money and time and am glad to be rid of this receiver. I just signed a release form for JVC to junk it. I ordered this phone for a Xmas Gift. I liked the uncomplicated layout of the controls and ease of operation in a reasonable space. I like the product.The only complaint I have is that the earpeace on the phone is very low no matter what the volume setting. I don't know is this is a defect in the phone or just the way it is made. If anyone has a similar problem please let me know. I hope this review was helpful. My e-mail is: ED.RAGNONE@USMA.ARMY.MIL Fan hub and blades popped off after one week.  Superglued it back on.  Then motor burnt out after about 10 months. The media handles the max speed on my dvd burner.  I recently ordered Ridata 16x dvd-r's which came damaged and refuse to burn at more than 4x. I purchased this keyboard for comfort and a carpel tunnel sufferer. I beat the crap out the this keyboard dropping it a few times and it works flawless. Don't know why others have had issues but mine works fine. I've had this for a month or so, and it continually becomes what the Sandisc tech calls "corrupted." It plays through my library of books on tape and then refuses to play them again until I reformat it. And reload my Audible library. So far, no satisfaction from the manufacturer. I unplugged my internet connection. I uninstalled norton systemworks 2005. I rebooted my computer. I disabled my firewall (Zone Alarm). I then installed Systemworks 2006 (With out GoBack). Rebooted. Reconnected my internet connection and firewall. Activated the software and ran live update. Scanned my system with anti virus. It deleted a trogen (Backdoor.Graybird) that Norton AntiVirus 2005 would not delete. Ran full system scan again. All ok, Product works fine for me as did all the other versions of Norton Systemworks did over the years. Seems that if you install it correctly it works just fine. I had no problems.  It works just like it stated on the package. This is a must have for new parents, my daughter had the tendency to startle herself awake but after we started using the swaddle me, she was sleeping 6 hours at a stretch at the age of 4 weeks. She is now outgrowing her newborn swaddle me so I have "upgraded" to a larger size since we can't do without it! I am very pleased with the product, the price and the service. I will reccomend all three to others. Issue solved!  I returned the Harmony for a full refund.  All thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team.  After screwing up everything on Christmas day (it was a Christmas present)), your support staff said "level 2" would contact me within 24 hours. After waiting 72 hours, I called "support" again yesterday.  After waiting 30 minutes, I finally got to speak with a real-live agent who "could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor's approval."  This was after providing the incident number.  That took another 15 minutes.  I then waited another 30 minutes (total now 1:15) before I had to leave. I tried again several hours later.  After being told "level 2 was not available."  I hung up and immediately returned my Harmony to .... Thanks, Logitech. -Keith Be cautious with which phone you are purchasing this software for....it's not compatible with Verizon's phones, specifically LG 6000 series.  They are accepting a full refund for return. A free downloadable upgrade which converts your Nokia N770 to the latest greatest OS2008 is available. To those whom gave this unit 1-star and said it included a so-so Opera browser and outdated Flash, [...] So grab one while you can and update it to OS2008 to enjoy the same OS as the N800... I bought this card for my brother, he has a Nokia 6230i that according to Nokia the phone's memory card limit was 512 Mb, nevertheless this card worked fine.  No problems at all. I purchased this very sleek cool looking fan for my husband's office desk. This desk fan has no punch! It does not provide the speed you hoped for on hot days. This is one of if not the best film of the year! The animation is fantastic! So is the Humor, and the music and the songs written by the talented Danny Elfman. The story is about a young man named Victor van Dort (Johnny Depp) who is engaged to Victoria Everglot(Emily Watson). But he can't remeber his vows and everyone (with the Exception of Victoria)is very critical about this! So Victor goes into the woods to practice his lines. So he puts his ring for Victoria on what apears to be a stick on the ground and says all of his lines which awakens The Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Cater). So Victor's wife is now The Corpse Bride! I won't give the rest away but I Highly Recomend this movie! It has a Variety Genre's to. It's a Drama Horror Musical Romantic Comedey. So see this movie! -Douglas "The Kid of the Arts" Edwards i'm on my second wick filter at this point and have no problems with them. they do discolor a bit in my humidifier at the top end (turns to a brown color) but there is no smell or visible mildew, so it must just be some minerals in the tap water that collect at the top end of the filter where the water evaporates. I am pleased with the performance and longevity of this product I have been using these since my son was born and now he is 2.  I will keep using them until he outgrows all of the sizes!  They are fantastic! These batteries are specific for the digital camera I have and I haven't had any problem after using them for over a year. son los mejores componentes, suenan de maravilla, es impresionante el sonido tan real.... The only complaint is not with the product but with the ads. There was so many choices and features and I felt they could have been clearer. I felt they were assuming more knowlege of the product then 1st time buyers would have. This is my 3rd GPS system and although I loved the others they are built into the vehicle and the upgrades are more then I paid for this system. Their advatage is they turn on and off with the vehicle. I would purchase this same system or similar Garmin product without hesitation. Cable that came with the card reader was defective and crashed my computer. Fortunately, I had a spare cable and the reader works fine. The fan moves a lot of air, but it's loud--combined with my pellet stove fan, it makes for a lot of ambient noise. Because of that, I run it only at night. Nevertheless, it gets the job done. We like everything about this AM/FM alarm clock w/CD player EXCEPT the radio does not stayed tuned to the channel you are listening to.  This is a real problem, and causes us to be dissatisfied with this product overall.  Is there anything that can be done to fix this problem? Your service stinks!!!!This item you think I purchased had been sold months ago!!!!I don't know if that is your fault or the sellers, but I wasted a month thinking the item was on the way!!!Is this your normal way of doning business?????How do you stay in business at this rate???? I've had mine 3 years with out a glitch.  I recorded my own announcements so that when a special person calls, instead of hearing a ring, my phone says, "Incoming call from ....."  Battery life is a bit limited, have replaced batteries about once a year, but i understand this is typical for phones that operate at this frequency. The pointer precision of the MX610 is terrible. Using the mouse just like driving a boat. This seller sure was on the ball and made my son's christmas extra special. I order this online on the 20th of Dec. Barry sent me an email stating I would have it by the 23rd. When I got the confirmation from Amazon they said I wouldn't receive it until the 31st of Dec. To my amazement, Barry pulled thru and I received my mp3 player on the day that he promised!!!!! KUDOS TO HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Item was never opened. The lisings on the box did not list the standard 1040  form, only the business tax forms. In previous years Turbo Tax for business, unlike this year included all these forms. I returned the item. I received an e-mail confirming the return on 3/08/06. But have not received notice that the amount of the refund has been completed. Thank you. I was trying to record some spanish shows on Telemundo, and the english closed caption is on CC3, which the traditional VCR doesn't support. So I was looking for a DVR/PVR that supports recording CC3. I have heard that Tivo can record based on the TV guide schedule, but I wasn't interested in it, I was only simply looking for a solution to my CC3 recording, and I did not want to pay monthly fee. After 2 months of straggle, I finally got Tivo since there is no alternative option left. After I play around with Tivo for 3 hours, I already have at least 10 season passes lined up on my Tivo and I am starting to worry I will be out of recording space soon. Tivo is addictive and amazin. Believe me, it is more than just a digitalized VCR machine. I had dialup for years and held out as long as I could because of the horror stories about Comcast, component compatibility, technology obsolence, etc.  I had digital cable already, and within 1 hour of the modem arriving at my house, I had a screaming internet connection.  Another half-hour and the wireless network was functional.  Can't speak to reliability, as it has only been running 3 days.  Absolutley no complaints with this product.  Maybe I was just lucky? This appears to be the same system Wal-Mart is currently selling for $394 (as of April 2006).  It's a decent system, but like all the other Sony home theatre systems, the CD/DVD player is painfully s-l-o-w!  Maybe Sony will fix this issue in next year's models? I've had it for a month now and the battery decided to stop charging. I've tried every troubleshooting trick I can and it just wont charge. HUGE dissapointment! The software is not very user friendly! I've had this clock for a couple of years. Every once in a while (seemingly random) the date will be incorrect. I can't imagine how this happens, since the clock is in a room where NO ONE ELSE GOES. Just this morning, I found it to be one day off. The time is exactly right on, but the date is off. Today, it was one day slow. Other times I've found it MANY days off. There is seemingly no indication that the battery is low. I'm just reporting this here, since this seems to be a clearinghouse site for problems/solutions for this clock. Please remove this item. Unless, you believe pushing bold-faced lies is acceptable...? I hope not. Bought the 42" version in 2003 - completely dead by 2005.  I was convinced into "upgrading" to a 50" in Dec. 2005 - Just died yesterday again... completely without warranty, so far my "early adopter" status with Zenith has cost me about $8,000 - and I have two funky things to throw out that the trash guy doesn't appreciate.  JUNK. We had to return the bedrail. The anchors were about 4 inches too short for our Queen sized bed. Tried this with two different computers using Windows Vista.  Got this message: "One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it."  The mini-disk that came with it was no help.  No response from Tiger Direct.  Went to Radio Shack and got one.  It works. I gave this to my 10 month old daughter for Christmas and she stands up at it but thats about it. My older children ages 4 and 7 seem to enjoy it more by singing the nursery rhymes. Its a cute idea but for babies there are alot better toys out there. FYI She loves the fisher price incrediblock. Re: Intego VirusBarrier X4 Since purchasing Intego Virusbarrier x4 10.4 for Mac OS X less than a month ago, I stopped using the product. Initially, I was very impressed with iVirusBarrier X4's ease, speed, and non-obstrusiveness (conpared to Norton's freakesh over-control). Nevertheless, after purchasing & loading VirusBarrier X4, I always had problems verifying disk permissions. Eventually, I had to archive and reninstall all my software, because of overall poor system performance, missing links, ad-nauseam. I recently learned that virusbarrier was indeed the culprit that ultimately lead to the tedious reinstall process. Sarah at Intego Support responded: "basically the Disk Utility is resetting the permissions to the incorrect (vulnerable) state. At this time, and until Apple addresses this security issue, you should not run repair permissions on restart." WRONG ANSWER: But thanks for blaming Apple for Intego's interface problem. Meanwhile, since having to reinstall all software again, I skipped over virusbarrier, and I have been in "disk permission" heaven ever since. FYI: there are no refunds. Just throwaways! Caveat Emptor!!!!! After receiving my Scangauge, I installed it and was initially pleased with the information it provided.  However, within days it began showing corrupted characters on the display and wouldn't store past data such as average fuel economy.  Data started over each time I started my vehicle, if it could be read at all.  None of the troubleshooting steps resolved the problem.  Perhaps I received one of the "bad" batch described by another reviewer. Outputs from HP 1022 will not match outputs from HP printers that support PCL 6. Applications that depend on precise print formatting will probably fail. I've had my 940MW for over a year.  When 1st received, after turning on, it would work for 5 to 10 minutes and then cut off.  I tried removing and re-pluging in the power cord and it would work for a few minutes and then the monitor would again cut off.  Then I tried a different approach.  I removed the power cord and squeezed the end that goes to the monitor with regular pliars.  SINCE THEN, THE MONITOR HAS NOT 'TURNED ITSELF OFF' ONCE! I believe that what was happening, in my case anyway, was the power cord connection at the monitor would heat up and expand and break the flow of AC.  Squeezing the power cord with the pliars 'tightened up' the connection allowing the cord to maintain contact.  I looked at the monitors plug hole after removing the power cord, and the connection lugs were inset into the monitor farther that I think they should be.  I think that that caused the problem. Don't know if this helps anyone else. That is the only reason I don't give this monitor a 5 rating. We installed this unit as instructed.  Once in place, my phone showed 4 bars beside the transmitter.  As soon as I tried to dial my phone, it quickly dropped to <1 bar, and the phone call was dropped each time. I did not have any luck with this item, and thankfully Amazon accepted the return with no problems. This card DOES NOT work with NOKIA 6682. I bought this card from an other website and missed the earlier review here. The product description does not show voltage details and compatibility with phones. It is very misleading as the description uses the word "mobile phone ready". Sandisk should address this isse by providing proper product description. This cheap piece of plastic broke within 2 months of me owning it!! Buyer beware!! I got this for my dad who has a Nikon D60.  It's a wonderful size for his camera and two lenses.  The weather cover was an added bonus which comes out from the bottom of the bag and fits over the bag nicely. This is one of the worst products I have ever purchased! Operating instructions were very unclear and performance of product was woeful! This product does all it says it will do. I installed it myself using only their directions and had no trouble. The consumer reporter in the Atlanta area, Clark Howard, suggested it as the wave of the future. It is wonderful and a purchase of which I am very proud. This item was sent by you to a freind of mine as I had instructed you, therefore, I did not see the item.  I understand that my friend has found it satisfactory. Tried to copy 1 tape to DVD after many (40+/-) played DVD's, it hung up, now won't play ANY dvd or CD!  Unknown Disc!  GoVideo computer (Customer support) hung up on me 3 times.  Nothing in manual about "Unknown Disc"  at all.  Strange we ALL have the same problem and GoVideo has NOTHING on it any where!  Methinks something stinks here!  (But my air purifier is on and it's obviously covering it up!) I have been on the Symantec Priority Help line for 45 minutes after two days of frustration.  I have used Norton Utilities for years with few problems, but this 2006 version is riddled with problems.  I can't install it on one of my computers after repeated trys in a totally pristine environment.  I had to uninstall it Systemworks from my laptop because it caused one of my important programs to freeze repeatedly. I am sending it back tomorrow.  Norton has turned out a bad product and offers no help. The details says it has DVI, theres no DVI.  The panel is fine, the speakers are cheap.  its an ok tv if it didnt lie about its specs The product does exactly what it suppose to do. It maintains the humidity to the desired level. You can feel the difference in the house. The only drawback with the unit is its noice level. But I have not used any other matchine to compare to. I purchased the Gateway CX200X convertable notebook from Gateway direct within the past month.  It seems to be exactly the same model as the CX2615.  I was very happy with the notebook until I realized that the display was showing an alomost imperceptible defect.  I.e., there is an area of the LCD display that rests directly above the touch pad that becomes very overheated when the unit is used in tablet mode - what you will see is a tiny area that glows slightly brighter than the rest of the display.  I was afraid that if this persisted overtime that it would permanently damage this part of the monitor.  Needles to say that Gateway denied any knowledge of this condition (that I and my IT team discovered) and I was assessed $150 restocking fee for returning the unit.  I argued that it was a design problem to no avail. This is obviously a design flaw, but Gateway will never admit it.  Beware! The ScanGauge-II does everything it claims to do. It is very handy for watching my fuel economy, among other things. I do not regret buying this product at all. I bought this as a spare for my Canon SD400. It looks identical to the one that came with the camera and it has what seem to be identical charging and discharging characteristics. In short, I think it's the same battery at about 1/3 the price. Because my left ear was damaged by Menieres' disease and surgery, these in-ear by Shure are the only earphones that have worked for me.  Wonderful product. Because my left ear was damaged by Menieres' disease and surgery, these in-ear by Shure are the only earphones that have worked for me.  Wonderful product. The ink made for my Canon MP500 printer. (Receive a discount for purchasing the PGI-5 2-pack pigment black ink tanks at the same time) No problem with the supplier or shipper but nearly returned the product for poor literature (no pictures) on installing the battery pack and using the charger.  You have a 50-50 chance on getting it right without a diagram. Reception was at least up to 3 miles when caravaning down the highway. I bought this product to transfer files from a specific computer.  It does not work.  This computer has Windows XP operating system and the DataTraveler works on all other computers/laptops but the one that I bought it for.  The driver won't install.  I called technical support and they told me I should just return the product. Just a quick warning: the description is misleading. While this player DOES support PlaysForSure DOWNLOADS, it does NOT support PlaysForSure subscription services like Yahoo Music... Oh my!  This item exceeded my expectations.  I have a T-1 (neighborhood shared) at home and DSL at the office, so it is like watching DirectTV on my TV at my office.  You can watch shows that are on you DVR, change channels,etc.  It is SO worth the money!  Santa is handling out a couple more this season! I have had this mouse for 3 days and love it. Some of the reviews complain that you can't re-program the e-mail and IM buttons. You can but you have to have the correct software installed. Using Setpoint 2.42a on the disc that came with the mouse, the Setpoint dialog box lists 12 programmable buttons. I was able to re-program the e-mail button to toggle MY Favorites on/off in Firefox. I then updated to Setpoint 3.1 whereupon the dialog box now lists only 10 programmable buttons, eliminating the e-mail and IM buttons. So I uninstalled 3.1 and re-installed 2.42a, re-programmed both buttons and the Mute button and then updated to 3.1 again. The mouse and all the buttons now work exactly as i want them to. my standard definition tv from the early 90's has a way better picture quality than this tv! this is no hdtv/ THIS PRODUCT PERFORMS AS PER BY AMAZON DESCRIPTIONS. IT IS PRFORMING AS IT SHOULD WITH NO  GLITCHES. ONLY THING I DID NOT KNOW, WAS PROCEDURE TO CHANGE MAPS TO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. I AM USING IT IN THE U.S. BUT SENT A COUPLE OF THEM  OVERSEAS AND SEEMS THE RECEIVERS HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS CONTACTING GARMIN REPS AND ADAPTING THEM TO THEIR USING COUNTRY. ALL IN ALL I AM VERY PLEASED WITH AMAZON AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS PRODUCT. Bought this tv about 2 1/2 years ago and just a few days ago I got the "pop" and black screen.  Talked to the Zenith/LG people and they said its out of warranty so can't help. Update  - If you have this problem, call 877-543-8325. I spoke with the supervisor and she took down my information and extended the warranty for this one repair.  No cost and the repair will be done within one-two weeks. Anyone of any skill level training for distance needs this technology.  It is awesome. I purchased 2 at the same time.  One was DOA and after the return process I attempted to daisy chain the 2 units per sell sheet.  Can't do it and tech support was no help.  I have had them 2 months and one unit runs fine.  The other has become noisy and I'm certain will have to be replaced soon.  Poor QC on these products. I've been using 3d motion controllers for around a decade and I feel confident that the craftsmanship and function of the spacetraveller are superb. Unfortunately, the footprint, while convenient, is fairly impractical for extensive design work since it lacks the mass and balance of the SpaceMouse, SpaceBall and SpacePilot. I have McAfee Antivirus that came with my laptop purchased early 2005. Before renewal in that is due in April, I wanted to have a CD that is for 2006. But I can not install it because with updates my antivirus is Version 8.0, since McAfee refuse to extend the expiration date I had been trying to return the product to Amazon for over 3 weeks. Somehow the Return Authorization package has not arrived yet. I am at a loss, hope to resolve the issue via email. The only complaint I have is that most of the time the directions that are given have too many unnecessary turns but it isn't too bad if the person is not familiar with the destination at all. this product is excellent no tengo ninguna queja con relacion al producto. No tengo ninguna queja con relacion al vendedor, todo llego en el tiempo establecido y en excelente condiciones.... Very pleased...If you are looking for an alternative to Microsoft Office you have found it. It's very complicated to connect in! It's keep broken everytime i tried to connect in my car. It's finally broken when it was on fired... The connector fell of and touched the cicrete thingy.. and somehow it was on fire.. I called JVC customer service to complain about the problems I'm having with my new system.  The man acted surprised when I told him not a single CD would play and the display kept reading "no disc".  He had "no idea what could be wrong with it", indicated this problem was "isolated" and had the nerve to ask me if I had dropped it. He then advised to unplug the system and wait before trying it again. Then I looked on Amazon and saw how many similar complaints have been made by others.  Obviously, this is an ongoing problem which requires replacement of defective parts.  The least customer service could have done was to be honest and acknowledge this defect.  I'm very disappointed in JVC and will not be purchasing other products from this company. I have gone through 2 of these gates. The ends are securely attached to the hardwood trim of the opening between my living room and dining room. However, I had to sew the mesh sections because my child figured out how to open the velcro (what was the company thinking???) and the hinges on the gate finally broke both times after about 3 months each time. I am now looking for a new gate for my 11 foot opening. Oh, I almost forgot, the plastic feet are not secure on hardwood flooring, so I screwed, yes, I said screwed, door stops into my hardwood floors to stop it from sliding because I thought that would solve the problem of the hinges breaking, but no such luck. The hinges still broke on the second gate. I would strongly caution anyone from purchasing this gate to be used on hardwood floors in a straight configuration. In addition, watch out for that velcro!! product received in a timely manner and as indicated.  the product works fine.  thank you. The features are neato, but the designers forgot one of the basic issues of electrical engineering: POWER CONSUMPTION.  This thing lasts about 5 minutes on normal batteries.  Therefore almost totally unusable.  Very disappointed. This was a software package. The cd had been opened and it was Scratched. I receive it by mail so who know what happen. The transmitter works, but you cannot hear the music through your computer's speakers at the same time. Quite disappointing, I like having my music playing from both my computer room and my stereo system in the rest of the house. I bought them for my Grandkids,and they said the mp3s were sic,so I guess they were pleased This product is simply amazing.  I have used it for a few versions, but the increase in OCR accuracy for version 15 is incredible.  I ran a 200 page PDF file of an auto repair manual through it.  It had a mix of column text, graphics and tables.  There were no OCR errors at all!  The output was so accurate it only took me 1/2 hour to proof the entire book and make a few minor pagination corrections.  For what this product does, and the time it saves me at my job it is priceless. I had to return the entire system for a refund.  The camera's came with a "warning" that electronic interference might occur.  "Might" is putting it lightly.  I have no devices under5.8Ghz other than the camera system itself.  The poor reception quality was truly outstanding.  After moving the camera closer and closer to the receiver (I got within three feet) the reception did not improve nor worsen.  I suppose in ideal situations this might work out fine.  I have a hardwired system now and am completely satisfied with the Swann hardwired cameras.  Wireless, not this system. The scanner arrived in timely fashion & pleased my son-in-law when he received it.  Thanks for a satisfying shopping experience. i bought this mp3 player for my sister and she loves it. although there was a problem with the headphones but se managed to work it out by herself. I was very nervous about installing the NSW 2006 after reading the Amazon reviews, I had absolutely no problem.  I removed previous Norton products, restarted, and installed the NSW 2006 in about 40 minutes. My system is working just like with the NSW 2005. BEWARE, the literature for this product says (on page 5), "WARNING: The cord(s) included with this product may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling." I can't believe they're still selling it, but we're sending it back asap! This was a huge help when my 24lb toddler got tired and wanted to be held. It enabled me to cuddle with her while having a hand free. A terrific product! I ordered the 4-Pack Color Ink Tanks for Pixma printers, instead, I received a brown carton containing 4 separate color ink pack cartons. When my Canon MP 800 printer was out of CLI-Bk and low on CLI-BM, I installed the new CLI-Bk ink tank. Initially the printer posted a message saying that either the wrong ink tank was installed or that it was defective. I called Amazon support and I reported the problem. The support person suggested that I install another color ink tank to see if it was accepted. Following that suggestion, I replaced the CLI-BM ink tank. After that, the printer printed as usual. Prior to this experience, I had ordered the same ink before, received a 4-Pack bundle, installed each tank at different times with no problems at all. On those occasions I would have assigned a 5 rating, but with this experience I have down graded to a 3, because of the time consumed in dealing with the problem. As you have read other reviews, the earphones could be better, sometimes you will hear music out of both, sometimes one or the other.  The only issue I have with it, is if someone downloads music on to it with another computer, you cannot pull the songs off with your computer.  Maybe I am missing something or doing something wrong, but over all it's not bad. I bought one of these for my grandmother for Christmas so she could be sent baby pictures, family pictures etc. without a computer.  Fantastic - she has absolutely loved it.  (We had to set it up for her - that was not necessarily intuitive and took longer than you'd expect.) But now it's only February, and the thing is broken - frozen on one picture for days. (And no, it's not locked.  We've tried everything.) Customer service operates under limited hours and has impossible wait times; they're not available at all on weekends and they have not responded to my emails. I experienced the same problem with this device as reviewed by others. Sudden changes in the brightness of onscreen material causes a resync. My setup is a PS3, HD DVR & XBOX 360 running into this switch, then a Yamaha Amp/Receiver to a Sony XBR TV. Every time a grenade exploded on an xbox game or any affect that caused a bright flash. The HD DVR experienced a similiar issue with sudden screen brightness changes or switching between an HD program and the guide. This is particularly frustrating when playing online games. The screen would suddenly resync to black and back to the displayed material in the middle of fights or major cinematic events. I guess there's a reason why it was only $40. I will be returning it. The scanner was defective and wouldn't communicate with my computer. I called Canon service tech and they immedciately sent me a replacement scanner, which I received today. It works perfectly.  Billie Glosup I have now had two of these in three years.  After a year or so, you ahve to replace the expensive battery pack.  I am very disappointed. This card does not work with Win XP SP3.  Recognized USB as 1.1 and NOT as 2.0 with drivers chosen by Microsoft and the disc that came with the card doesn't address XP at all.  Further, the Sabrent website has a homepage only and all links are non-functional. This is a darkly funny film.  Although not quiet as light hearted and clever as its predecessor Nightmare Before Christmas, but it was quirky and cute all the same. Hi all. We already have "Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0" Is the upgrade for the CS2 available from this existing product? (Quoted at the $149.00 rate?) Kind Regards, Michelle Serious bang for the buck ! We own 3 of them now...that says it all! Does what it is supposed to do, but paying $38 for a piece of plastic that probably costs 50 cents to produce is crazy. has equalizer built in, mic recording capability, folders for organization, fm radio, mp3 encoding, lock, and on and on all with a very competative price. I had no trouble installing this once I called the cable company and gave them the MAC ID.  Doing this first would have saved a lot of time.  Since then, the product has performed 100% better than the modem I had rented from the cable co. My daughter got this clock for Christmas and she loves it!  She loves waking up to her favorite CD, programmed to her favorite songs.  This clock works just fine! Worked for a short while, then stopped recognizing any DVD's. may have something to do with illegal production methods and seizure ny california authoities in June of 2006. No customer support available. It holds my sunglasses, cell phone, keys -- everything that I've tossed on it holds securely around corners, sudden stops -- whatever.  My dashboard has a slight angle to it, but it holds beautifully.  It's a wonderful invention at a wonderful price. think carefully before buying this brand.  Bought another model (cost $149), broke in 1 week.  not under warranty and company does not repair their product. Does what I wanted. Keeps the camera protected and clean.Size allows taking along the basics.I will be getting a longer carrying strap. I prefer a cross-body strap for the camera and this is too short. Hey, Case Logic, how about a longer adjustable strap ? This calculator is limited to a very basic set of functions. It has 12 modes, each of which lets you calculate a limited number of variables after the input of another set of variables. The Amortization mode, for example, permits the calculation of only 5 variables: the remaining balance after payment x, the interest portion of payment x, the principle portion of payment x, and the interest and principle paid between payments x and y. Each of these variables requires input of the  monthly payment. Stupidly, the calculator does not allow you to calculate the monthly payment itself (based on loan amount, term, and interest rate), and will not you let you calculate any of the other 5 variables without inputting the monthly payment amount first. This makes the calculator useless for most mortgage calculations. I bought these in the store for about $60 and returned them as soon as I could.  I tried them on and found that the metal slider extender piece got caught very easily in my hair (taking them on and off).  For that reason alone, I returned them to the store.  I felt it was a poor design flaw. This adapter requires a 9v battery to power the sensor. I tried two different batteries in mine and it refused to turn off no matter what I tried. In the night only setting, it was on constant in the daytime. Will be returning this one. Does what its supposed to do.  Can't ask any more than that. Product would not work on inside wall in house .When I pointed it toward the tv station thru a window it worked ok after a bit of fussing .Would not recomend unless you can aim at station thru window window These lights are not as bright as they are advertised to be - and I've had several die on me in a very short span of time. Very disappointed with this product. These lights are not as bright as they are advertised to be - and I've had several die on me in a very short span of time. Very disappointed with this product. I bought two of these cables, since they were so inexpensive.  They work perfectly.  I'm glad I bought them.  More specifically, I'm glad I bought *two* of them.  They are very cheaply built - and not surprisingly, considering the price. 1) When you extend the cable, the wire "remembers" its shape and tries to coil back up.  More expensive retractable cables are pliable, and don't curl up when you extract them. 2) The round instruction "badge" spontaneously slid off and got all gooey in my hot car.  This is very minor. 3) When I accidentally dropped one of these from a modest height of maybe 4 or 5 feet onto my laminate floor, it EXPLODED in a fountain of springs and plastic pieces!!  Oops. I've only had this crusher for a couple weeks but have used it almost daily.  It does a wonderful job and I've had no problems with it at all. My husband is an "ice eater" & loves it! mcaffee offers these rebates but refuses to honor them and you can see that this is a known issue I ordered the wrong video card. This one doesn't fit it my system. I have attempted to contact Computer Geeks 4 times now and I have received 1 reply from a bot. I would accept a call from somebody in India right now. It would be better than the nothing I'm getting from Computer Geeks. No rating for the product. 0 stars for Computer Geeks. If I could have given it 0 stars I would.  I have a virus on my computer that deletes my printer files - NAV didn't even pick it up.  When I contacted customer service I got the run around - these guys were telling me stuff I had already thought of.  After paying an additional 39.95 for service, and wasting 1 1/2 days of my life I got nothing.  I ended up having to re-install windows and they won't refund my money.  All I ended up doing was chatting with a bunch of what I guess by their names to be Indians.  They kept wanting me to spend more money to upgrade my service to their premium level.  What a joke. I bought this for my grandson's birthday and it was a hit. But, three weeks after he received it, it just stopped working. The company we bought the player from is accepting the return and crediting me for the defective unit, but needless to say I have a very disappointed grandson. We are replacing the player with a different brand. This product does not work with Windows XP. It crashes all of the media plans (Windows Media Player, WINAMP,...).  So there is no way to synchronize your play lists.  There are a lot of complaints on the Sansa forums about this, but Sansa support ignores customers.  I am repeating this review for the same players with different memory sizes, hopefully to help some poor person that buys this thing. The MP3 player I received was different from the one pictured.  I was disappointed, but the model I received was a newer model and a better player. the unit is quiet and sufficient cables for an up-to-date motherboard, if you are not using the SLI video card. it has couple to fan speed that you can chose from, i like it. Got the card and it's worked just fine.  I've used it for about 6 months. I have a beautiful baby girl who just so happens to have a bad case of colic.  These hot water bottles are the only thing that calm her down enough to sleep it off.  I have ordered three bottles now - one for home and one for each grandparent's house. This item is such garbage!!!!  The only way the receiver stays on when docked into the boom box is by pushing down very hard and keeping your hand there or putting a water melon on top of the receiver balanced by a water bottle.  I've exchanged my boom box twice and receiver once--the manufacturer will not refund me, ahhhhhhh such frustration!!!!!!!!!  Not to mention 3 times I've had to stand in line at the post office and all the money spend on shipping and insurance.  Save yourself the headache do not purchase this product. I bought two cases, one for the camera that I owned and one for a camera that I ordered for my wife.  The case will fit through your belt or in your pocket.  My problem with carrying a camera around in my pocket is that the camera gets scratched up if I put it in my poket with my carkeys or loose change. Ended up to be a frequent conversation piece in my tech office.  It can't be turned off unless it's unplugged.  At max speed the noise level is acceptable.  Actual cooling was about 3C lower for my Dell D620 blowing constantly.  However, the fan faces me more than the laptop anyway. This is a brilliant film but Burton/Elfman/Depp. The animation is astounding, the music is catchy and riveting, and the overall atmosphere is creepy and beautiful. The only problem I had with this was that it was a bit too short: just less than 80 minutes. It could've been a bit better if there were 15 more minutes of film. But anyway, "Corpse Bride" is another dazzling accomplishment by Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Danny Elfman. A definite must-see. A- The Flash Drive I bought was delivered on time and in Mint condition at the price promised. If i have the opportunity to by from this seller I will without hesitation. This title is horrible. Clunky, S-L-O-W, non-intuitive interface and antiquated looking maps. Then, you must constantly swap CD's in and out of the drive. It was a pain and I have 3 CD-ROM drives! They should include a utility that mounts the volumes as needed from imaged CD's. Why did NG ever approve of putting their name on this? DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Stick with Google Earth. NG Backroads Explorer 3D TOTALLY sucks. Though one of the more challenging pieces of furniture I have ever assembled, this media cabinet now houses our moderate collection of DVDs, CDs and VHS tapes in style. The fact that the assembler can determine the height and number of shelves is an excellent feature that gives the unit some flexibilty in usage. I have been using my 2GB SanDisk Titanium for only a few months. It was working fine and literally a second later it was no longer working. It won't work on any computer. I have lost the most recent version of several articles, some of the lectures for my classes, and on and on....I am furious. How can I recover the data???? If you like your music with a heapin' helpin' of hum, buzz, static and other annoying music un-friendly effects, then this is the product for you!. The addition of the grounded turntable cord helped somewhat and made the quality jump up to just annoying. If there's a cost effective way to convert vinyl albums to CDs...I'm still waiting Picked up a local radio station better than my baby's cries.  Maybe in another location this would be fine, but here in Northwest Tucson it's all static and talk radio all the time. I purchased this maintainer for my motorcycle to keep the battery up over winter.  This does the same thing as "Battery Tender" but costs half the price. I have two other larger Schumacher chargers that I have owned and used for ten years. Just did not fix my slow pc or internet lock up issue.  All in all did not fix a real problem or issue with my system registry and was not worth buying for me and my issues. As always, Amazon shipped within days, and it came with the power supply. I bought this for my son for his birthday, and he hasn't stopped playing on it since. Now he will be taking lessons! I used a LaCrosse Technology BC-900 AlphaPower Battery Charger to test these batteries (for sale on Amazon.com, by the way). The BC-900 can condition batteries by repeatedly charging and discharging them until no improvement in battery capacity is measured. I applied this feature to the Power 2000 batteries. Conditioning is a necessary step prior to testing new batteries, since NiMH batteries need several charge/discharge cycles before their maximum capacity is reached. I used the most gentle setting that the BC-900 offers: 200 mA charge, 100 mA discharge. I used another feature of the BC-900 to test the capacity of the POWER 2000 batteries after conditioning was complete. Again, I used the most gentle setting. This should result in the most optimistic estimate of battery capacity. Results? The four batteries measured: 2190 mAh 2120 mAh 2070 mAh 2140 mAh Nowhere near 2700 mAh, eh what? I suggest that all products from POWER 2000 be scrupulously avoided. This company is clearly dishonest. The biggest problem with this alarm clock is that you can't read the display  unless your are standing nearby and looking down at it.  This is due to the angle of the front of the alarm clock and the fact that the display has the ability to change colors.  The fact that it can change colors is neat, but rather impractical if you can't read the time from across the room. I recently upgraded from an earlier version of Norton to NIS 2006 and that began a whole litany of problems - slower computer speed, inability to open MS Office documents, inability to access the internet, inability to shut down using either "shut down" or "restart" buttons, among others.  Brought my laptop to a local repair shop.  The technician informed me that NIS 2006 is a very aggressive program and can cause conflicts with the MS operating system itself.  Additionally, installation of NIS 2006 requires complete removal of the previous version(s).  Simply using "Add/Remove Program" will not assure complete removal and therefore when NIS 2006 is installed there may be conflicts with remnants of the legacy Norton program.  The technician did a complete uninstall of NIS 2006 and I have since purchased McAffee Virus Scan which seems to be doing the trick. I can't properly review this item because the sanDisk MP3 player was not compatible with my iBook G4 so I had to return it. Please, could anyone tell me if this product is compatible with Fuji FinePix S5100 ? Thank you! Tinted windows seem to play havoc with satellite reception, but with an aftermarket external antenna (sits on the dash at the bottom of the windshield and costs $25) it works just as advertised. This is the biggest piece of poop I ever installed on my computer.  And I built my own PC from scratch (20 yrs in the industry).  The install corrupted my XP files and the Memeo "uninstall" process failed which left corrupted files all over my computer.  It took me over 5 hours to repair and I still have not managed to delete all the Memeo trash from my desktop.  And I've been a tech programmer for 20 yrs.  What a disaster! YOU ARE BETTER ROLLING YOUR WINDOWS DOWN! THIS THING DOES NOT WORK. I HAVE A SHARPER IMAGE ONE THAT IS ALOT BETTER. THIS ONE IS A GENERIC IMITATION THAT DOES NOT CLEAN THE AIR. CRAP!!!!!! Who would have thought a 20 cent dongle would cost $600 to repair? Yes, the USB ports are welded to the motherboard. Yikes. Sony's support has been going downhill, in this case practically useless. I got both Norton and McAfee trial versions on my computer.  Dumped Norton shortly, and McAfee shortly thereafter because they were more trouble than they were worth.  Windows has a firewall, I have free antispyware, and my ISP blocks spam.  All I need is antivirus.  My mom got the 2006 suite, and it didn't work at all on her Windows 98 machine.  She gave it to me, and it now lives on my computer instead of hers.  I only installed the antivirus component on my XP machine, and it seems to work for me just fine (that aspect of the software suite). Subsequent comment: I'm thinking that maybe my earlier problem with this working on my computer is that I have CyberSitter installed, and I later learned the two conflict. As usual, GE hides the fact that they are the real manufacturers. Wonder why that is... I bought this phone just over 3 months ago, and now it just quit working. The only thing that works, is the receiver... and I could haqve bought an $8 phone from the Dollar Store to do that. Now that I know, GE AND RCA is off my list. Size and quantity might be helpful if you plan to sell any of these....  :\ We purchased this case and ordered the Olympus stylus 800 at the same time. When the camera came we found it didn't fit into the case. We called Olympus and they said the case was for the stylus 600 and they did not manufacture a case for the 800. Unfortunately, we received the case before the camera and discarded the non-english portion of the instructions and so we probably won't be able to return it. The case may work fine for the model 600, but if you have the 8 megapixel 800 it's useless. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!  Works just as promised. I'm writing this review after using the Griffin RocketFM for only three days.  That said, it does exactly what I bought it for: transmitting high fidelity music from an online streaming service to two home stereo systems.  One system is about 12 ft. from the RocketFM transmitter and the other is about 20 ft. away and through a wall. Low fidelity issues were solved by the following: 1.  Setting the device volume output to about 65% (control panel, sounds and audio devices) 2.  Slightly lowering the volume output of the player (Rhapsody player) 3.  Activating and maximizing the EQ of the player (Rhapsody player) - this made a huge difference Fidelity issues after the above adjustments were due more to the receiver (tone controls, antenna) than my PC or the RocketFM. To it's credit, the RocketFM was truly plug-and-play (worked immediately after plugging it in) and my PC's speakers had returned simply by unplugging the RockteFM from the USB port. I am extremely disappointed with this product. It claims to be a 5.8 GHz but I can't move as far from the base as I can with my 2.4 GHz cordless phone. In addition, it has the habit of cutting off in the middle of calls!! Can't rely on it. Every single time we have used it, it has spilled out all over the stove and made a huge mess.  Threw it in the trash eventually.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!!!!!! I installed this twice.  One time I installed the whole thing.  Later I installed just the scanners.  Both times my computer was so screwed up that I had the reinstall my os which is XP Media Center edition. Some of the problems this software caused include: being forced to insert my sonic software cd at every bootup, my computer freezing up every so often, my computer abruptly shutting down, not being able to boot up successfully, and not being able to access my dsl connection. CA should be sued for selling this junk. don't know what is going on here... the Nikon D50 is a DSLR camera, not the Coolpix shown in the picture or described in the description. don't know what is going on here... the Nikon D50 is a DSLR camera, not the Coolpix shown in the picture or described in the description. Ordered 12 days with regular shipping before my trip but arrived late.  It took more than 16 days for delivering an in-stock item within California.  I suspect they deliberately hold an order for any regular shipping method. I was concerned with the warning about these radios containing lead and the need to wash your hands every time you used them, so I returned them unopened, I was dissapointed as I was exepecting them eagerly. Excelent product, i owned for a week and the response and signal is flawless, the next week i'll change the firmware (that's the reason of bought it) I never write product reviews but the air case has safisfied me completely.  I have had the case for a year or more.  It is scratched but so what?  Without it I am sure I would have destroyed my Palm. You can synchronize and reboot without taking it out of the case. I tried four copies; three were bad, one was awful.  This lens has been very favorably reviewed, and I find their 50 f1.4 to be magnificent, so I took a chance.  The only thing I can think, based on what I saw in the files, is that in each case, one or more of the elements was out of alignment, because they didn't produce a normally focused image at any focus distance.  Something 10 feet away on one side would be in focus, and something fifty feet away on the other side would be.  Very strange. The only reason I purchased this item is because it uses the same fan that my AOpen mini-pc has, and that went south. If I could find this fan at Fry's or someplace else, or if AOpen actually had a technical support staff that responded to inquiries, I wouldn't had to pay $35 for a $5 fan (the alternative being to toss a $1000 computer). My low rating for this item is entirely based on my opinion of the fan. I am already on my 3rd CPU fan for this computer (thus I have bought 2 disk enclosures), so I would suggest this fan is absolute junk. I BOUGHT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY DAUGHTER & SHE LOVES IT. SHE CAN DOWNLOAD BETTER THAN I CAN. I bought this monitor for my wife on the advice of her fitness trainer at the "Y".  She is not the technogeek type but took to this monitor right away.  She uses it on every workout to help maintain her proper heart rate.  (Seems as we age- this becomes more important.)  She likes the style and color and she uses it.  What better recommendation than that? But for the record I did not bother contacting the seller to return it.  After all, it was $1.00. after reading the positive reviews i thought i would have a positive experience with this product. Unfortunatly it didn't happen that way. I spent 1 week trying to connect it to my windows XP computer and it wouldn't do it. i called Lynksys and spent 2 hours on the phone with them rearranging my setting, connection and disconnecting. it was horrible. It's a 50-50 thing. maybe it'll work, or maybe it wont. just keep the box until you decide it does. Gained nothing from this Hi-Gain Antenna. The magnetic base and cable was a benefit when affixed with a common shorty rubber wireless antenna but otherwise too expensive.  I wasted my money. Very sturdy when placed on windshield or on mounting disks on my dash, glad I order 2 of them Very sturdy when placed on windshield or on mounting disks on my dash, glad I order 2 of them This antenna is so lightweight that the base can't hold it. When the "rabbit ears" are extended the whole thing can topple over. I was very disappointed. Thank u I both this watches like a gift 4 my father, he rally likes it. It was fas. Thank u. Outstanding product.  Exceptional after sale customer service and tech support for questions.  Superior to all vehicle installed systems. Excellent, and reasonably priced via Amazon. It might be difficult to program but the tech line will solve it and it's done. All these remotes are trainable and when a problem occurs, you click on "Help" and it asks questions, then carries out changes, and asks whether that fixed the problem, until it does. Fascinating. I attached this antenna to a D-Link DI-624 wireless router to try to expand the range then all of the wired ethernet ports started dropping connectivity and I was getting "hardware error" reports from the network monitor. Took the antenna off and it all worked fine again. You would think D-Link would have at least tested this with their own product. Initially caused some issues that have been taken care of in the latest releases and updates. Had issues after a few updates but the subsequent update always fixed the problem. There are 11 computers between 4 homes in my family and all browse the internet without any spyware issues. Excellent piece of software. I managed to sync with WMP ONCE before neither my laptop or desktop would recognize the device.  I spent hours trying to fix the problem until the e260 suddenly and completely died.  I sent it to Sansa but I don't expect any help . . . I just got this TV and am very impressed. One note, a prior review said this TV was 2K cheaper at Costco.  When I looked, I found a Pioneer 50", but it was a different model. PDP-50A5HD This HDMI cable is quite a bargain. It does a beautiful job. Forget Radio Shack and the Monster rip-offs. I purchased three with no problems. BL This CPU cooler keeps my temps down up 30 degrees lower than the OEM heatsink under load.  The variable fan speed controller is very useful.  The only problem I had was  that the heatsink is so big I had a hard time getting it to fit in the case.  I had to grind down one of the "wings."  I am using it with a 3.2Ghz Pentium D. I hadn't seen this for a while, but purchased for a quiet food/movie party for Halloween for a diverse group of 13 adults.  Quirky, charming, bittersweet and funny - the whole group laughed and clapped through it. I don't know techno jargon but picture and sound looked fine to me on a 40? 60? inch screen.  If it hasn't been posted, FYI the story was inspired by a 13th century Jewish folklore tale where a young bridegroom accidently marries a corpse. I wanted to Yahoo Messenger VOIP using a wireless headset, another Motorola product the HT820. Motorola support has been helpful but unsuccessful resolving setup issues.  The headset with the PC connects only with repeated setups and often without the microphone.  Getting the microphone to work so that I can VOIP with the PC is a curious setup problem. The Motorola headset works fine with my cellphone. But buying this USB blue tooth adapter to connect the Motorola HT820 headset to the PC's unsatisfactory. Bought battery with belief that it was an APPLE produced battery based on item description: APPLE PowerBook G4 15" (Aluminun) Main Battery.  Upon receiving the battery it was obviously not Apple originated. Therefore, my Apple Protection Plan is negated. The audio on this game skipped and it ruined the fun of the game.  My kids like the songs especially and when the song sounded chopped up, they lost interest.  The Atari customer phone line is closed and their website only suggested to update the audio driver installed on your computer, which i did and it didn't help. I bought two of these for my granddaughters. Neither would work. I had extensive conversations with SanDisk. There seemed to be a problem with the firmware revision on these MP3 players. They suggested that I return them to the dealer. The way that it zips from the top to the bottom so that the zipper pull tab isn't in her chin is very cool. I had unexplained shutdowns with the Coolmax V-400 power supply. Replacing it with the Coolmax CXI-450B cured them. As both supplies are from the same manufacturer and both claim to be ATX12V 2.XX compliant I?m not sure what the problem was. The CXI-450B is quiet and is running stably. I wish it were modular as I could leave out cabling that I don?t need. All in all a quiet and stable power supply. The vcr works fine, but the dvd player didn't work from day 1. It plays for a minute or two, then freezes. I brought it to a repair center and the tech told me it was the 4th one he took in during the past month. The toll free# is 800-311-9263. If you can wait a day or two for delivery, why pay more at the retail store for genuine Canon quality? When installed CD, it can not be recognized by my lap top. So, I could not install it. Dump.... I ordered this case based on the picture on here, and the one i got does not zip-up and looks very girly, like a purse. I ordered a case to keep dust and sand out of my camera because i'm deployed to Iraq, and the case they sent is useless to me. I emailed the company with no responce and if someone from the company see's this please let me know if i can exchange this. Thank-you As others have said it's a very good product. If your vehicle has lots of gauges on the instrument panel such as my silverado, there is some redundency. But, I have taken my MPG from 20.5 to 24.9 based on watching my throttle position and my MPG. But thats considering that I am using methods to maximize gas mileage such as tons of coasting and shifting into neutral. If I simply did regular driving while being cognizant of the information the  scanGauge provides I would probably experience a 10% fuel savings. The velcro method for attaching to the dash is mediocre but works. After installing the drivers on Windows XP, I was surprised at the number of features available for the touchpad. It does everything described in the ad and flawlessly. I experienced non of the problems mentioned by other users. It arrived on time and worked flawlessly out of the box! Very happy with it. I just burned one disc and approx. 50% of the overall surface area was left untouched. Be aware! Drive becomes un-usable when a large number of files are transfered onto it. The drives is detected in Windows XP, registers itself as a device,  but after that data transfer cannot be done, coz of I/O errors This charger is all and more than what I expected for the price.  I have been very pleased with no negative comments. This charger is all and more than what I expected for the price.  I have been very pleased with no negative comments. I bought this thing, thinking it was something else entirely, installed the doggone thing, and have found that it does absolutely NOTHING that my Mac is not capable doing with the software that came on the HD for FREE. Of course, now the package is open, and there's not a chance of returning it. Completely worthless. The description gives the impression that the material is made of hard rubber and that it can protect you ipod in "rugged" conditions. In reality it is made from very thin flimsy rubber. I suppose will protect you nano from scratches and other cosmetic damage, but it will not porvide any protection from drops or other rough handling. I plugged my Nano into this charger for about 10 minutes and picked it up to check it out - it almost burnt my hand. My Nano is now Toast! I hope it just toasted the battery and not the whole device. From the creator of The Nightmare Before Christmas, the marianettes return to grace the stage and enchant the mind in this veritable aesthetic sequel to the Halloweentown masterpiece. Set in repressive Victorian England, Victor Van Dort {who seems like a grown-up Vincent}, is a groom-to-be who stumbles out upon the grave of the morbidly lovely Emily, a dead bride who whole-heartedly accepts his vows while practicing in the woods. At the insistence of their families, he was betrothed to "Victoria" {read Ed Wood's 'Victor/Victoria'}, yet their oppressive natures sets him to seek solace in the nearby wilderness where he rehearses for the ceremony. By the by, he feels himself growing fond of this corpse bride who takes him down to meet the denizens of her world, where he becomes acquainted with all sorts of interesting characters therein, consisting of a collection of free-spirited rogues, including a dancing skeleton named "Mr. Bonejangles" {Elfman; an obvious take on Sammy Davis Jr. complete with an eyeball which moves independently from one socket to another}, Paul the head waiter {a literal head with a French accent who goes about on spindles protruding from the neck}, a worm-like maggot with the certain features and personality modeled after Peter Lorre, a rather cute black widow spider, and a dog named Scraps who could very well be the skeleton of Zero. Barkis Bittem is a black widower and a generally right rotten bastard who acquires his wealth on the deaths of previous wives, including Emily. With the mystical help of Elder Gutknecht, Victor, Emily along with her dead friends, walk the earth with the living to gather in a church for their marriage, despite the protests of Pastor Galswels {Lee}, where Barkis makes an appearance, who meets a proper demise. A surprising turn of events ensues with a beautifully bittersweet ending. The worlds of the erstwhile dead and the living are juxtaposed between the colorful underworld, and the dismal mortal world above, where 'the dead' seem liberated from perfidious constraints. The visuals are superb in that splendidly gothic ambiance with a glorious soundtrack to match. No CGI, just the wonderful implementation of this past orthodoxy, preserving this magnificent theatrical art. Corpse Bride is yet another marvel to be added to one's collection of cinematic favorites. I purchased a Scangauge II for my 2004 Hyundai XG350L and when I plugged it in my speedometer stopped working and I got a zero MPG reading. I tried it in a different vehicle, a Chevy Tahoe from work, and it worked perfectly. I called Linear Logic and they rep told me that some manufacturers didn't follow the OBD spec but the unit works in those vehicles if a couple of pins are removed. I asked which pins so I could remove them and the rep told me not to do that because then the cable wouldn't work in most other vehicles, they would send me another cable with the pins removed. I gave him my address and was waiting for him to ask me for a credit card number but they're sending the second cable with no charge to me. That's what I call exceptional customer service. The problem isn't Linear Logic's, the problem is Hyundai's and yet Linear Logic is making it right. Linear Logic is an outstanding company. Bought 3 pairs for all my cars. What a waste of money: didn't last a week before they started to smear windshield! Garbage! This backpack is a must for anyone who needs to carry both their laptop computer and camera gear at the same time. This backpack is a must for anyone who needs to carry both their laptop computer and camera gear at the same time. These swaddlers calm a crying baby during the day and help them sleep at night! The tighter you wrap the better they sleep! Thank you Swaddleme!!!!!! I have 2 1020's and 2 1022's .  Once they start working, they are fine.  But I have had problems installing the driver on 3 different computers.  Last time I stayed on the phone with Tech support for over 2 hours.  I gave up and bought a different printer for that computer.  If the driver problem had happened only on one computer, maybe just chance.  But for me the 1020 printer driver has been the driver from hell. Would definitely deal with this seller again.  Delivery was on time without any problems. awful! I think that I was defrauded. From the photos and explaination of this product, it seems to ber made by IPEVO.Actually it isn't. awful! I think that I was defrauded. From the photos and explaination of this product, it seems to ber made by IPEVO.Actually it isn't. I will be looking for other device for this feature. But tried this device with several car radios with lots of static on all. I am very pleased with this product and with the company. It shipped very quickly and everything was just as I expected and wanted! All of my drives--internal and external--are made by Seagate. I have yet to have a problem with them. My only disappointment with this one is that there is no Firewire port. It is only USB 2.0. I did some comparison shopping.  Couldn't test other cell phone signal boosters, but this was in the right price range to do what I needed.  Read complaints about it not working for people and other reviews stressing that it has to be installed correctly.  Without this booster, my signal alternated between 0 and 2 bars, and that in only a few spots.  With the booster it is 2 throughout the house and 3 or 4 bars closer to the booster. Could be better, but I'm satisfied. I got this from Motorola to work on my RAZR to keep my calendar with me on my phone.  The sync for the calendar works with Outlook 2003 but it won't sync recurring events that have an end date. Perhaps it has nothing to do with the modem or the manufacturer, and something to do with my cable service from Comcast, but the modem just did not work. All the lights were blinking, but the modem would not connect to the Internet, so I had to return it and that is the only experience I can share. Effective English acronyms "find dictionary"!

She has been scanning all her photos from the last decade! My sister loves this scanner/printer!  She has been scanning all her photos from the last decade! very pleased,it does everything it's supposed to.I had some problems learning how to delete unwanted music. probably my fault This unit has it all. i put a 2mb card in min and loaded it. gets 20 to 25 hours of batter life with my rechargeables. I've got this hooked up to my Samsung 40in HDTV.  The picture is perfect.  I saved a few buck not going with the monster. Thought I was buying a waller with four CDs / DVD slots on each visible page, but this one only has two.  Hard to tell from the description/picture. This software attempted to change my computer's video settings upon installation, and then wouldn't install instead attempting to change my video drivers. I am very experienced in using computers and I've never seen behavior like this before. My only guess is that this is a port from what was originally a Macintosh product and is basically incompatable with XP.  That's not to say it couldn't be installed but I was not into fixing my computer after letting a piece of discretionary software break it. This film is enjoyable in content and imagery. The voices are wonderful and artistically, the design is beautiful. There is a slightly morbid undertone that makes the film not acceptable for young children unless they know and understand the idea of death. For a busy CPA, especially during the busy season, it has been a tremendous help in maintaining client records effetively and efficiently. I purhcased this product from PCTechsystems through Amazon. When I got it home and plugged it into my ipod - I heard a distinct distracting "white" fuzzy noise in the background on every channel I changed it to. PCTechsystems would not refund the money for this item. A member of my family is very directionally challenged.  This helped her with a 350 mile trip to Dallas, around town and back.  The GPS unit recalculates if we did not follow directions.  It remembered where we were if we stopped while navigating to the destination.  Setting the destination takes some getting used to, but it is helpful.  Awesome product. I agree with the two previous reviewers.  There needs to be a user manual and there isn't one.  The fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees.  This isn't very helpful for star gazing.  The maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches.  This is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing. Celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together. Very pleased with receiving the kit promptly and was just what I expected. The CD Player was non-operational from day one, then it worked intermittently, and then finally stopped working altogether and just got stuck in "Read" mode. JVC customer care referred me to a local authorized repair service who exclaimed, "oh, another one!" when he saw my unit. He said he had worked on others with the "same problem". After about 6 weeks he informed me that he was unable to repair it and he referred me to the JVC service center. I had to pay shipping costs for the entire unit with speakers to the JVC service center. Over $125. JVC center messed up my address, in spite of me having corrected them 3 different times. They klepto'd my cd's stuck in the cd player. Their customer service who is located in a city different from the repair center just kept reading from their script and basically kept giving me the runaround as to why it was taking so long to repair and return my system. Finally, after more than a couple of months they told me they couldn't repair it, so instead of giving me a new unit, like the one i sent them, they sent me an "exchange unit" which finally arrived, nicely packed, but full of nasty fingerprints and smudges. It looked like someone splattered hot dog chili sauce all over the main unit. JVC should be ashamed of themselves for treating their consumers this way. This clock drives us crazy- when you try to shut off the alarm- the clock slides all over- (shut-off is on the side)- it should have been on the top! Poor design. It was a gift for my adult son who is an avid bicycle racer.  He is extremely pleased with the item. I am pleased that it was shipped within about 2 days and received in a timely manner. It works as advertised. It is a bit in loud end to keep in the room at night. I would suggest to place it somewhere in the outside of the room, if you are a light sleeper. It is very dependable however, as it has been working for over 2 years now. I think all humidifiers are laud by nature. Filters are reasonably priced at Amazon. And, you must change the filter once in while to avoid molding of course. After all, this device filters the surrounding air while humidifying it and captures a lot of dirt and airborne bacterias. Problem: Dark staircase. No A/C outlets. Solution: Maxxima MLS-01 Occupancy Sensor LED Lights. We placed one at the bottom and one at the top of our staircase. The sensor knows day from night, thus saving battery life. The light is bright, but not over powering. i have had this stereo for several months now and i have had no problems. As another reviewer wrote (George Washington), I saw the positive reviews and was influenced by them.  This is a true dog. I too contacted (no phone) by email Kaspersky, received a number, no reply, then emailed them with the number, again no reply. A donation to the Salvatiion Army or a charity of your choice is preferable.  Like the other commentator (George Washington), go back to Norton or McAfee.  Both are superior. This doesn't merit a one, but it's the lowest allowed. It merits a minus 10! I Ordered mine thinking they were all black, but when the shipment arived they were black and grey. The picture is missleading. ALMOST THE HIGHEST IN  MAH 2700MAH  THE HIGHEST I'VE SEEN IS 2900MAH ALMOST THE HIGHEST IN  MAH 2700MAH  THE HIGHEST I'VE SEEN IS 2900MAH The installation instructions are based on buying the program on-line and downloading.  I can not find how to register the software with out buying it again. The program has not removed references to deleted programs as I expected it to. Received this as a gift and when our Ruth grew to be too heavy for the hand-me-down bjorn we had, this hit the spot.  I am 6'3" my wife is 5'4" and it adjusts easily to suit both of us.  The back support is a life-saver and Ruth loves cruising in it.  Definitely a must have in our house. I just purchased 3 of these for my family.  The unit is constantly showing "Unknown" for artist and album.  I'm a software engineer so I live this stuff.  I wrote MP3 tags in ID3v2.3, ID3v1 and APEv2.  I updated the player using the file explorer and windows media player.  Nothing worked.  I finally called technical support and they suggested I had 3 faulty units!!  If I got 3 what is the chance that you're about to buy a faulty one! My daughter loves this car seat! Cute fabric and lots of room for her to stretch. It must be the most comfortable and safest car seat around. I wasn't looking at spending a lot of money on a phone, but for the brand and quality, this phone was perfect. Thanks! Brought this on Jan 3, 2006, returned it on Mar 10, 2006. Holmes seems to have rectified part of the tank warp problem, because the tank did warp, but not enough to cause any leakage. I used it almost everyday during the 2 months that I had it. It would have lasted out this winter, but would have definitely failed next year. Just what I was looking for, very functional, a very solid mount would recomend it to any one. Symantec's so-called customer service website is the most confusing, frustrating, bug-ridden, and unhelpful commercial website I've ever visited. And yes, I've been to Hewlett Packard's. After years of off and on futzing with where to plug in X10 controllers, some things not working, trying moving things around - arggh! I put in a hard wired phase coupler by the panel - it barely helped. So now, I just plug in this repeater by the clothes dryer and holy cow, everything works just like it should. I removed the useless phase coupler, now using only this 4826B repeater and things are swell. All travellers within the USA should have this device as a piece of travel gear. It is affordable and reliable. According to the manufacturer, this car seat carrier is NOT compatible with thousands of infant car seats on the market despite the clearly misleading name "Universal".  I bought the top rated infant car seat by Britax and then this carrier based on the box which said compatible with Britax.  After reviewing the instructions, I found it was not compatible with this and many other infant car seats. I bought two of these... one broke down... can't turn it on... I tried calling the customer service... emailed... etc... but NO ANSWER!!! I just tried again... but their voicemail box is FULL!!! JUST REMEMBER! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I just received this mobile as a shower gift and installed it on our crib.  It is advertised as being super quiet but I am finding that it seems loud when it turns.  I am not sure if I should exchange it, or if they are all like this.  Please post a reply if you have any comments. This is a misleading price unless you order just a single unit. I ordered 200 of these to send out to our customers. The shipping was over $1100.00 for 4 pounds!! In other words, the shipping charge was about 150% of the unit cost PER UNIT. Naturally I canceled the order. They are obviously making the profit on the shipping. I am sure the actual product is fine and I have used Kingston I will not order anything from this particular vendor, BlueProton again. I don't like being ripped off. when I was looking at the Liliput 7", Amazon told me that 85% of customers who looked at that product bought this Coby product. but the reviews seem to show that the Coby stinks. is there anyone out there who's happy with this TV? when I was looking at the Liliput 7", Amazon told me that 85% of customers who looked at that product bought this Coby product. but the reviews seem to show that the Coby stinks. is there anyone out there who's happy with this TV? I have since moved on to RHEL and then settle on Ubuntu, but Suse Linux is a very comfortable fit for someone transitioning from Windows to Linux. William J. Macdermott, you are wrong. The Panasonic KX-TG5433M is availble at very common brick and mortar stores like Target and WalMart. If it were, it would have been designed with a sleeve that didn't fall off in your pocket, when you don't notice it, etc. It comes with three sleeves (is this an admission of a design flaw?), and in less than 3 months, I've lost all three. It's no longer a portable keychain usb drive, if it's unprotected in your pocket. If you plan on using this as a daily workhorse, in and out of your pocket, you'll soon lose the caps and sleeves. This program mostly prevented me from connecting to the internet, so I guess you could say it is the ultimate internet security package. I ended up unintstalling it and sending it back to the seller for a refund because: 1) When I booted my computer (a Pentium 4, 2 GHz, 256 ram,  Windows XP), Panda loaded itself before Windows was finished loading and hung up Windows on the "Welcome" page with a largish Panda-in-your-face icon. 2) When I clicked on the panda icon to determine what was going on, nothing happened. 3) My computer would remain this way for at least 45 minutes, at which point I would get totally frustrated and turn off the computer. 4) But,the only way I could turn off my computer was to unplug it; the power button wouldn't work. Panda has taken control! 5) It only took 4 or 5 times of going through this scenario before Windows would finally load. 6) I had this problem constantly for over 2 weeks, despite trying every feasible configuration of the program. 7) I contacted Panda Software about it via the email address they suggested on their website. I never received a reply. 8) Once I uninstalled Panda, everything worked just fine. 9) Taking into consideration the lack of customer service and poor performance of the product, I think they should have named their company "Abominable Beast." I paid top dollar for PS7 and thought it was time to upgrade to CS2.  After I installed CS2 I discovered that I could not crop any photo without having my PC crash.  Every time it crashed I looked at the defrag utility and I had fragmented files all over the place.  Then I defraged the hard drive and went back to CS2 and tried to crop the same photo again.  Again, my PC hung up and was unresponsive and the defrag utility said I had to defrag.  The only thing I did was to crop one photo in CS2, and that was enough to make it necessary to defrag again.  I uninstalled this piece of garbage from my PC.  It does not work, and I don't care what Deke McClelland says and I don't believe what he says, either. Save your money.  These rip-off artists at Adobe are nothing but thieves.  Yeah, they ripped me off for $153 but you know what?  At least I have my integrity, and that's more than you got, Deke baby. This shredder consists of a shredder unit which sits on top of a plastic bin. The shredded paper tends to fall in a heaped pile, meaning that when the shredder is approximately half full, shredded paper touches the rotating cutters, and wind back into the mechanism. If you empty the bin after shredding 20 sheets or so, it seems to work more reliably. This is a fuss. To empty the shredder, the top is lifted from the bin. It usually deposits pieces of paper on the floor. The shredder will strain to shred six sheets, and if the sheets happen to fold while feeding, it will jam. One or two sheets will normally shred OK. The shredder has several levels of safety features - turning it on requires flipping two switches on top, and the bin must be in place underneath - if you lift the shredder while it's on, it will stop. However, because the shredder jams so frequently, you may find that you will have to pull chunks of paper from between the rotating cutters, which doesn't seem a safe design. I am another one of the customers that is having trouble with this lens and the autofocus on a Digital Rebel XT.  It locks focus less than 50% of the time.  My other Canon lenses don't have this problem. I wanted to protect me brand new computer from virus attack, and finally i got the kind of virus by installing this software. I installed this software and it crashed totally my computer. I paid 70 $ more to retreive my data and then I am going to reinstalle xp to the computer. I think they should rembourse us for total cost and waist of time. Ordered two fans. One was defective and other was n't effective. Another thing, they do not rotate. I bought this device 2 weeks before and out of the box it was not working the way it should. Some of the problems that I faced are : [1] 30mins for a Satellite connection [2] 30mins for Heart Rate Monitor to display data [3] Calorie reading way more than what it should be. I checked the website and found that mine had an older firmware and GPS software. I downloaded the WebUpdater which lets you update the devices software/firmware automatically. After updating the device, it seems to be showing correct info. Now, I'm beginning to enjoy the device. I encourage those who have problems with the device to update to the new firmware/software. However, the following features, in my opinion would be very helpful: [1] Wind Velocity [2] Wind Chill Index [3] Temperature [4] Humidity. [5] Web Based utility to configure the system. The first 4 features, I felt, would be very useful in comparing various runs. Gopi My wife bought me a Nike sportband for my training but it wouldn't ever calibrate for my slow running so I returned it and bought this instead. This thing is amazing in its capabilities. Since September I've dropped my 5k time by 3 minutes since I can now watch my heart rate stay in the proper zone so I don't short sell myself while not overdoing it. On top of that I had another item in the order for which I would have free shipping.  Now they're charging me for shipping on the remaining item because it is now below a $25 order... I ordered another USB power fan installed in a kitchen cabinet (approx. 2'x2'x2')to cool inside where computer is housed. The fan was quiet but didn't move enough air. When the doors were closed(not completely) the inside temp would be about 10-15 deg. hotter than room temp. Now with the Thermaltake Mobile Fan II installed the temp sits about 2 deg. higher than room temp. And that's not at it's highest setting. Bought the program and it worked fine.  Memeo then sent an automatic update and from that point on when the computer booted up  I received a message that "Memeo has encountered a problem and must shut down".  Detail inside the message show  "possible corrupted database."  Sent the error message to Memeo at least 30 times and asked them to call or respond.  No response!  Found a phone number and called it and their voice mail box was full. I'm now looking for a backup program that will work and where customer service will respond. Works just fine.  By the way, Brian Morris of Pittsburgh isn't too bright, is he? I ordered one and within a few minutes of plugging into a USB port, it went to full speed and stayed there despite any change in knob setting.  I returned it and promptly got a replacement.  Same problem. It does what it says it'll do.  If you have a psp slim it won't fit onto it. This product was exactly what was needed to cool off my home theatre system. The combination of features such as variable speed and retractable power cord made for a very handy package. I purchased "My Wedding Organizer" through Amazon because I trust this sight.  However, this purchase has been an extreme disappointment.  The program will not open.  I have contacted the My Wedding Organizer sight  3 times, and their technical assistant, but they will not anwer their phone nor will they respond to email.  This was a waste of my money.  What is my recourse? Penny Bolton I've copied two VHSs of operas that I wanted to back up. Unfortunately the English subtitles have got lost in the process. Sadness since my German and Italian are minimal. No one has mentioned that it plays DVD-ROMs. If you copy a DVD in your PC using Nero Recode, some DVD-RW drives - like my two, a Philips and an LG - enable the book style of a DVD+R/RW (including DL) blanks to be changed to this. Very handy. Still a shame about those lost subtitles We used this product an average of once a month for 2 years and it no longer works.  The company is out of business (no surprise).  On a similar model from Mintek, they had to send out a recall because the battery would explode while charging.  Please try another brand. I bought this because I made a web page on my laptop and when I uploaded it to the web and looked at it from another computer all the colors were way off. I was hoping that this Huey would make it so all my monitors were the same color. It did correct the color on my Asus laptop and brought it closer to the color of my other monitors. I ran it on 3 computers all next to each other and all 3 monitors have slightly different colors. I ordered a computer from HP 3 weeks ago and have had nothing but problems.  The customer "service" is the poorest excuse for service anyone has ever witnessed.  As of now I wold sooner toss the 1400 dollar computer off a bridge than EVER reccomend anything from HP! Five stars for Dora from my four year old! She has been playing, learning and having fun with it for a whole weel, and she came to me and said, "thank you for buying Dora!!" She just loves it! I was sent a external card reader instead of what I ordered. Maybe the picture and product information isn't the same. Very sturdy mount for my 60" Pioneer plasma.  I extended it out to the maximum, and hit 3 studs 24" apart. This product was as described. It is a normal thumbdrive with the only moving part was the USB protective cap that pops off. It was at an awsome price for $.89 plus shipping. One reason I prefer this over the SanDisk Cruzer is that this Kingston is not partitioned for drivers and unessasary files needed to run a thumbdrive like the SanDisk Cruzer series that popup everytime you install it. I do prefer the "Switch Blade" style thumbdrives but for $.89 it works and does what it supposed to do. The DVR completely changed how I watch television, making me in control of how and when I watch television. If you don't have a TiVo or other-brand DVR and watch a least an hour of television a day, you'll be amazed. --Ken LaCorte Though the movie had its charm, I was bothered by it. The onset of the film established a gloomy tone which prevailed throughout, which would have worked well if there had existed some kind of comic relief at all. I spent the entire second act feeling sorry for all of the principal characters and without any humor it just weighed me down. Again, if there had been any humor element at all, it wouldn't have been such a downer. The villainous character receives his dues at the end in a last-ditch effort to satisfy the audience. It was so contrived. He brings about his own demise by grabbing a sitting goblet and drinking it, without any real idea of its contents. It felt like a simplistic device to bring about what the audience was naturally waiting for. The songs were forgetable too. Thanks reviewers! I will renew my subscription to 2005 Internet Security with which I've never had a problem instead of 'upgrading' to this mess. As for auto upgrade download times...Glad I have a cable modem you dial up people have my sympathy (but not my $45 per month bill) I was just browsing for tools when I came across this so called "value pack" of Milwaukee batteries.  Just seeing the picture of the batteries raised by blood pressure several points. Yes, they will die on you, and sooner rather than later, leaving a wonderful drill useless.  At least they've lowered the price on them to a point that is CLOSER  to their true value... I suppose to appease those of us who must continue to purchase them. When I bought the drill I couldn't believe these batteries were as bad as people were saying, but now I'm a believer... I had the same problem.  The update on January 6 was a disaster and its not the first time.  I couldn't send or receive Mail through MS Outlook.  SpySweeper was disabled and I couldn't reinstall it.  My operating system came to a halt.  I had to turn the power off at the switch because I couldn't reboot.  I've had this problem at least 5 times with this version of NIS 2005 and had to completely uninstall it (which I was able to do) and reinstall it from scratch.  It appears to be a bug that isn't in all versions since I've installed 4 completely independent copies for other customers with no problems whatsoever. The help chat, phone support and e-mail are unacceptable. I would not reccommed this product. I have an MS Degree in Computer Science, and this product has caused nothing but problems. I am writing off the $40 I have spent. This product does not allow you to have more than 1 system and register the software. I have bought numerous dell outlet systems that come with 90 day versions of McAfee Virus Scan. And I have one registered version of McAfee virus scan. The version I paid for cannot be installed on my new system. I like all the features of this telephone.  It seems to be reliable, and the built-in answering system saves me a lot of time by allowing me to screen my calls. Got this router because it ran linux. I got DD-WRT, a third party firmware and got it hooked up using WDS. I'm very satisfied because I have more wireless coverage in my house and I didn't have to spend $100 on a wireless adapter. Plus it's faster wired and have 3 more ports for products I need to hook up in the future; maybe a PS3 perhaps? Couldn't complain! using it for running biking hiking, full files the purpose where it was purchased for maybe i'm the defective one, but it took like 20 minutes for me to figure out how to open it. instructions for y'all's reference: rather than pressing straight up on the tab, press inward, toward the palm pilot. I've tried 3 other DVD editing programs.  None of them can hold a candle to Ulead.  It is the only one I've found that can work with .vob files.  It's editing functions allow for precise, absolute control. It does what I expect it to do with no problems.  It is inexpensive and so lacks some features, but I am very satisfied with it. Connects phone to computer, allowing sync of the two address books. On a Mac, there is no need for the software, as Apple iSync handles it all. The description leaves some things out.  A remote conrol is included, and it will play VCD, SVCD, MP3-CD and music DVD formats in addition to the ones listed.  A fine unit for under $100. This radio worked OK for a few months. I only used it at home, running it off of AA batteries. The crank worked fine--didn't try to run it off of solar. But the thing died when I took it camping. Left it in the truck and the humidity apparently messed it up. Couldn't change channels or switch from AM to FM to SW, etc. Trashed it and won't be buying another. Cheap plastic disposable Chinese junk that's absurdly over priced. This product could put user/customer's life at risk. The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road. This is the worst product that I have used in my life. It is very convinient thing. It has an excelent security system for notebook, so you shouldn't worry about everyday carry of you laptop. The Nuvi 350 is discontinued.  Although this product works fine you'd be better off buying another model with updated technology, such as the 260. I tried three different phones (same model) from three different vendors (thinking that I was one of the unlucky ones to receive a bad unit) and they all have very similar ringer problems -- Line 1 ringer doesn't work, or the phone doesn't ring at any of the extensions when you are on one of the lines, or it Line 1 rings but line 2 doesn't. I am very disappointed at the quality of this phone.  When I called Motorola tech support, they passed the buck to my phone provider saying something about baud rates and that the company needs to adjust it in order for the phone to work reliably.  What a bunch of crap from tech support!!!  I currently have a Siemens two-line phone that works just fine, so its obviously an engineering issue with the phone. I can't believe a company like Motorola would release such a sub-standard phone to the market.  How long have they been in the phone business? I'm using it with my Casio EX-Z750 and it seems faster then the camera actually needs! 8) After less than a year, these headphones have broken three different ways.  I've tried to fix them along the way, but superglue isn't cutting it anymore.  The foam cushion slides out, the plastic that holds the headband to the sound piece breaks, there's an obnoxious click in the right speaker that I learned to deal with.  But now one of the speakers has stopped working altogether and I can't figure out why.  Maybe a year is a while to have gotten out of a pair of headphones, but I didn't abuse them.  I would have liked them to have lasted longer. Amazon needs to be more honest in their description.  A subscription to the TiVo service is required and the TiVo box will not work without a paid subscription to the TiVo service. This item arrived very quickly.  It's an inexpensive way to test for radon in the home for peace of mind.  Thanks! I have "installed" this item and it sits here and collects dust due to the buggy , immature install design, you have to hook up cables to parallel and serial ports and if you don't have them then "simply" add them.. crap , Should be redesigned as a simple external box with usp2 interface.. this is a lousy product. michael Railey Dallas, tx. I gave it to my son for Christmas and he is very happy with it. Am thinking of getting my husband one for his birthday. Words cannot describe how this phone sucks!! I have had numerous occasions where people are cut off in the middle of leaving a message, or they left a message and it was not recorded. I am using this phone for my business and it is costing me money.  I will be forced to buy another brand because this is the second Panasonic that has done these things.  It is not dependable. Sorry. But I have to disagree with the majority of comments about this player. It would not successfully transfer music from subscription-based websites. (It would, however, transfer music that we already had on our hardrive.) We kept getting a "device certificate" error when we tried to transfer songs from both Rhapsody and Yahoo. (And yes, we purchased the highest subscription possible so that we had unlimited dowloads.) I think the problem is that there are too many possible vendors contributing to the error. We couldn't figure out if this was a problem with Microsoft (Internet Explorer 6 and 7 would not work), Microsft's Media Player, the software associated with subscription based websites like Rhapsody or Yahoo, or with the Sandisk itself. All combined, I would estimate that we spent up to 16 hours (unsuccessfully) trying to transfer music. This included searching bulletin boards for the error, 2 separate online chats with Rhapsody, dowloading the appropriate firmware for the m240, and speaking with a customer service representative from SanDisk. Fortunately, despite my hard-headedness, I've come to the conclusion that it's NOT worth my time to try and figure out what or who is at fault here. Goodluck! I gave this to my fiance on her birthday, as she is training for a half marathon and she is very happy with the product.  So,obviously, I'm satisfied. Replaced a NetGear modem that would drop every week or so with my Comcast service and maxxed at 3.5 Mb service (paying for 6).  The motorola syncs faster, boosted speeds to 5.2 Mb and so far has stayed up consistently.  (Used with a Dlink router) We didn't realize until we purchased the mount that not only does it hang on the wall but can move forward and be turned to both sides I'm very pleased with this unit. It was a bit of trouble to mount it due to the interior of my car but we got it done
