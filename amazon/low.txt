Probably worked right for about 6 months.I was disappointed with these earphones. The sound level was low and higher frequency sound seemed attenuated.  The $30 Sony MDR-EX51 earphones I already owned sounded much better.Met all expectations, easy to use, low price, what else can I say.Worked well and immediately discovered virus software that was affecting my PC.Connected upscaling DVD player to 40" Samsung LCD.

Two calls later, they sent the second drive.  The first worked well and I just received the second.Excellent ink for excellent printers. I will never use those cheap inks ever again. In the long run, those cheap inks really aren't so cheap.Great item, much cheaper on line thru Amazon than the local Big Box retailer. thanksIf the iTrip much away from the radio the signal lost and no good soundOne earbud just stopped working after a month.  Enough said.bought this item for new big screen to improve reception, no better than the much cheaper item that it replacedThis product never worked....period.

Poor Quality, wouldnt stay on, Awful Awful Buy.worked slowly from the start.  difiicult to remove and insert. the worst flash drive I have ever purchased.Works well is you standing next to the unit.  Get ten feet away and the signal drops significantly.Great looking on desk,  Performance good, but not great. Performs task w/ short distances,  doesn't like much interference.It's really good even better than teh one I've lost, I use it under water and still transmiting ok. very good productNot sure I like the bleeder....  Almost seems to sensitive even bending the hose will read .5 psi...Great sound ,very well done player.It is better then iPod Video.

I bought in december 2005 and the product still working perfect.   I RECOMENDThe first one failed in a week, BUT the second one is still truckin along good.Excellent 95% of the time; only occassional static, but still good.  Amazon was the cheapest place.nice game, but very short, the replay value is almost non existant even for a child.These speakers sounded quite nice for me while they worked, with a nice crisp upper range. However, after a few months they intermittently stopped producing sound. I'd recommend you stay away from these speakers --- they could clearly do with better quality control.This is not right at all, cancelling my order!!!!  We need to assemble and consider legal action!  All who agree, keep posting.  Eventually they will hear!  Maybe they will actually honor their errors for once!I have used several hundred Verbatim DVD-R discs and have never had a defective disc yet. Excellent quality.The sharp microwave is a good product. Looks nice and runs great. Shipped in great time.bluray disc pretty good quality, very detailed, nice colors... the sound is pretty good too, I highly recommended it!Nice shade, pretty easy to apply, but can be ugly if there are air bubbles.  Doesn't cover whole window.Well, I received a used open box item with defect from Amazon.  It will go back to Amazon tomorrow.I bought this for my niece and nephew and the microphone never worked. Save your moneyTook forever to locate satellites - TomTom much more reliable - BUT user support in Kansas excellentI was sick of the cheap "Moon" style battery powered lights they sold at the hardware store. They rarely worked. Sylvania DOT-it Silver Self-Adhesive Bright White LED Light is a breath of fresh air. The LED technology is solid and is currently lighting my pantry. Perfect in every way.I was sick of the cheap "Moon" style battery powered lights they sold at the hardware store. They rarely worked. Sylvania DOT-it Silver Self-Adhesive Bright White LED Light is a breath of fresh air. The LED technology is solid and is currently lighting my pantry. Perfect in every way.i have had these 6 months, and they have broken already.  the folding portion is poorly constructed.  they were under normal usage conditions, i hardly folded them.  cheap.  bad news.It does what it does well.  There are better values around for MUCH lower cost. Still looking for a good **Active** Noise Cancellation headset.Works great.  Handles 3 wireless connections + 2 lan pretty well.Even after removing the radio antenna on my truck the signal was full of static on every frequency. Obviously an inferior product.Looked like a piece of junk. Poor quality. Poor manual. Didn't work at all. Sent it back. Stay away from this one!.....It's good to see that customer service is Amazon's top priority.Works extremely well. Recalcultes routing almost immediately if you fail to make the directed turn. Easy to operate and program. Great unit.great service, shipped the product right away, and even though one of the blocks were defective, they shipped a replacement right away as well. thanks for great service.So easy to set up.  Less than 10 minutes from start to finish.  Instructions were easy to understand.  No issues getting a signal.  Highly recommend!This turned out as the gift that our daughter wanted and used it immediately testing many things she wanted to know, Very good product !!!I had nothing but problems with this recorder. It worked fine at first; a little quirky with certain types of discs. Over time, however, it became more and more picky about the discs it would read. Now it won't even recognize your basic single-layer commercially pressed disc--let alone DVDs it recorded itself!This set was great up until this week and suddenly the sound went out.  My second Sharp TV set to have problems this week.  Guess I angered the Sharp Gods.Newest Sakhalin oil industry practical English Russian and Russian English terminology and phrases! RECOMMENDEDRange is very weak probably less than half a mile. Don't waste your money.Great transaction and product delivered on time or beforehand and  excellent condition, well wrapped.Purchased this item after long and satisfactory experience with Uniden products.  Good functions and easy to use, but very noisy and poor reception.  Not recommended.Great remote. Pretty expensive. I will probably not use all of the features. Still well worth it.Do not buy it. Unable to print long documents without jaming. HP put out a terrible printer.It appeared to be new and looks like I am going to get the rebate back.  ErvPrompt service, item received exactly as promised, actually before I expected it. Highly recommend this vendor. jpcExcellent sound, prompt delivery and even with the shipping they were about $10.00 less than Best Buy.This filter does a great job, lasts long, not expensive and is great for dry winter weather.Worked great for a month. Then I couldn't send e-mail from Outlook. Internet worked fine, as did incoming e-mail. A real time consuming troubleshoot as the router itself was low on the list of likely suspects. Changing to an old Buffalo router cured the problem. Have yet to try collecting on the warranty but not looking forward to it.Amazing sound, great fit.  I was used to "in ear" headphones already so there was no issue of discomfort.  Great deal on a great headphones.Works fine. Saved me $50 buying this one over the Sony memory stick (which is probably made by Sandisk anyway)Read the reviews.  Purchased the product. Installation went well. Worked first time.  Gave life to IDE drive without a home.I used these batteries for my mp3 player, after these batteries are charged, they last for pretty long.  Good quality.Great!!!  Love the USB power and compact size. Well designed scanning software with an abundance of automatic and manual settings.Works really well as a fast backup option and a good way of keeping a laptop hard drive cleaned up.VERY POOR QUALITY. I BOUGHT A DVD RECORDER FROM THEM. IT LITERALLY STARTED SMOKING. LUCKILY THERE WAS NO OTHER DAMAGE.Easy installation, excellent performance, very good signal in 100 ft radius. Highly recommend.Horrible - the first time I slid my nano into the case it put several scratches on the front; defeats the purpose for even buying it. I would recommend getting an Agent 18 case.If you are looking for a noise canceling headphone this is nowhere near it. I wont reduce any sound except for low frequency; really low frequency.They had a high pitch buzz in the right ear, then it went into a VERY LOUD static noise!....I really like amazon but this item sucked!!Everything went well and the product performance is excellent.Apart from that hassel free shopping.Product came with time and proper packing.Experience shopping with Amazon was too good.These tanks are cheaper thru Amazon than at local Staples plus the shipping was free and they got here next day.  I will always get my tanks at Amazon.This cover is almost neon green. It's REALLY bright... so consider this before you buy it, considering if you like or do not like bright colors.I run hot and cold on this product.  Maybe it is my PC but I have good and bad days with it....sometimes noise (whines mostly) other times seems ok.The video works great but the first audio input would cut out pretty frequently. I tried different fiber optic cables and got the same results. The second audio input worked fine. The fiber optic connections seemed quite a bit looser than my stereo receiver. Not sure if that's what caused the problem though. I am sending it back.This product was terrible.   The joy of great price shortly replaced with the anguish of poor performance.It worked well for the first 24 hours..... Worse....I lost all of my 245 songs since the freaking thing stopped working. Don't buy it. Spend your money in a "real" mp3 player.I find it quite difficult to scan a page and save it. I is much more cumberson than prior scanners I have owned.After attaching the cable properly to my HP Laserjet 5P and my new Dell Vostro PC the cable worked for several days and then stopped working.total darkness in low light, i didn't belive other people when they told me this was bad for low-light, but they are right. very bad audio quality, too. easy operation, though, controls are well positioned.Comes pre-scuffed hard to open made of cheap plastic opening at the top for stylus but have to open the case to use it?!!! Dumb. Look elsewereMaybe it's a great camera, but unable to get it working at all.  Installation software is really horrible, manual is even worse.  Can't Sony hire someone who speaks/writes English?  Install software is very strange, they don't understand the conventions/basics of writing a Windows application...really disappointed and frustrated.I bought a Pantone Huey last October...it worked great until January, then just died.  Tried re-installing software, using a different USB port but nothing worked.  Wrote to Pantone and they replaced it with a new one, no questions asked (good!).  The second one lasted about 3 weeks then also died.Never drops my net connection. Always great thruput, even with teenagers running LimeWire and watching YouTube, while I'm e-filing massive documents across the planet. Really a first-rate router!clean, fast, huge enough, great price too.  Thankfully, I bought this and backed up my Emac, several times now,  and have not had my old baby die first!Replaced a defective Christmas present by ordering the same product from Amazon, saving nearly $100.  Delivery (free) to my door. Life is good.hold a charge for a long time, better than generic rechargables bought resently.Excellent price for an excellent product.I dropped it once and it still continued to play the audio cd without skipping.Very good anti-skip function.The laser assembly unit makes a bit of noise when starting up and when skipping to different songs,but it is only a superficial defect.Great sound quality and good bass boost function.Again great buy.I bought 3 for above the sink.  Even with all 3 turned on, it isn't bright enough.  All these really do is offer mood lighting.  To make things worse, the light isn't white but rather a very light blue.Motion sensor is excellent.  Just the right amount of light for a dark room.  Price to value is excellent.  Highly recommended.Excellent functioning, easy to use 2 line phone. I wish it was made in the USA instead of made in China.very good system, good recording easy to use good sound on phonesThis is our second purchase. Just as great as the first. Well packaged and shipped. Great product. Assembly is a snap!This product is pretty good; However, the only trouble is getting hold of Customer support.It was an ok purchase. I was hoping for much clearer recording capabilities, but they are not great. Has a good sound. I still can't figure out how to stop it from always starting a song where i left off instead of letting me go pick which song to start with...It's very easy to use. Easy to set up. Very exact with instructions. Graphics and sound is just right. I highly recommend this product.I had read reviews both positive and negative.  Plug it in and worked great.  I recommend this item!!Very good refurbished product at a great price. Save money by buying a refurbished GPS.These headphone worked great on a recent flight. Worth every penny, and it's much cheaper then similar productsThis transmitter is GREAT - best one I have had.....it is worth the cost - easy set-up, and great sound quality...Well-received by the new parents who got this as a gift.  Just what they wanted!it streached out the first day i used it...horribleItem arrived and screen did not work. Manual was completely useless. Called tech service at Mintek and voice mailbox was full so could not leave a message.Wrong remote control TWICE!  I had to order one from other place.  Otherwise my DVD/VCR combo works great.Garmin 60CSx returned, because half of menu buttons did not function. Amazon promptly replaced with new functioning unit.I bought 3 for above the sink.  Even with all 3 turned on, it isn't bright enough.  All these really do is offer mood lighting.  To make things worse, the light isn't white but rather a very light blue.I bought 3 for above the sink.  Even with all 3 turned on, it isn't bright enough.  All these really do is offer mood lighting.  To make things worse, the light isn't white but rather a very light blue.excellent product and real easy to install,and as a matter of fact I purchased two!Easy to set up..Great for my home security. Would refer to anyone wanting this item.I tried this antenna and didn't get any better reception than my old rabbit ears.The only negative side that I found is the keyboard. I liked the old powerbookG4 keyboard style better.This was the cheapest enclosure and it works fine.  Great for making USB Backup Drive out of your old hard drives!Didn't see many noticeable enhancements since 2005 except the performance seems to be much better.I can't say enough good things about the 24" Samsung 244T. Super bright! No dead pixels, & my HD video never looked so good.Installed and worked great on a HP laptop with Vista.  Feels cheap, a better quality enclosure would make this unit perfect.I've used this item for several months.  No problems yet.  The cap does seem to be a bit loose.  Never did snap on tight!  I think it will fall off and get lost soon.  Considering the price, It's a still a deal.The retail price is totally wrong. I could get it for cheaper from another vendor.I really like this monitor. You can see if the baby is moving even before they start to cry.  Really good.Noisy and doesn't move air. In short, it is completely useless for its intended purpose.I used it for a trip to the northeast and loved it.  I never got lost or confused.Yes.  Emails and phone calls to tech support required.This is very much as advertised......it works perfectly and solved my switching problem Highly recommended.Worked only two hours before locking up. Firmware or memory is bad.Big disappointment.  Locked up after less than a month, won't get past the initial Sansa splash screen.  Avoid.easy to use, works good, good headphones, easy to read interface. This is a very very good buy.The receiver is a great bargain and sound quality is amazing!  Very easy to setup.I bought 3 for above the sink.  Even with all 3 turned on, it isn't bright enough.  All these really do is offer mood lighting.  To make things worse, the light isn't white but rather a very light blue.First day it was working perfect, but since the other day it, not working properly!Great price, good speed on nikon d200 and hp hx4700 pda. nothing bad, all good.total ripoff buy jbl or logitech or altec insteadPowered right up and has been working very well.  Easy to install and plenty of hook ups for the computer accessories.Good fit, easy to put away, sound okay. They even look good . Purchased 2 pair for myself, but my friend appropriated one pair after using them.THe FM modulator works fine.  The cigarette lighter splitter stop working after the first week.These headphones have better noise cancelling but the sound quality is not as good as the E3c-n series.This item is the best item I have ever gotten.  Easy to use works excellent.beautiful  electronic item bright colours easy plug and playI tried many FM receivers, none of them really worked well, just way to much statics and makes ipod heard unbearablewhat can i say easy to use, reasonable price, and good qualityA lower end heart rate monitor. It's works fine for displaying your HR. If you want to keep track of multiple things simultaneously, get a higher-end version.i wish that the lcd screen lit up, it is hard to see, but oven works great otherwise.Another easy transaction! Good product for the$$.Only time will tell how effective...Heathen hackers anyway !!Got these for Christmas and I love them! Have tried several different earbuds looking for some that actually do shut out the exterior noise without breaking bank! These work very well for me.Works Great no problems other than putting it together factory a bit sloppy but I worked it out.Easy to install and relatively inexpensive means of providing protection for your entire electrical system, particularly in storms. I highly recommend.The retractable usb plug is sturdy, and works well!This is a great tv but get it cheaper else where. I used hsn with 5 payments and saw it even cheaper at walmart.....check it out but make sure you get the best buy for you.The old linksys is dying after 6 years. This new linksys fits all my basic needs, setting up a local network.Easy to install.  Fair picture quality.  Good price. Easy to move around.  Works seamlessly with linksys wireless router.Mine arrived with a non-working power supply.  The whole thing quickly went into the trash and I bought a RocketFish instead.Mine arrived with a non-working power supply.  The whole thing quickly went into the trash and I bought a RocketFish instead.I remember playing this game in the fourth grade, and I loved it. I bought it recently and it still plays well. I can't say enough good things about it.Great antenna. Saved lots on satellite tv bill. Great picture quality on local HD channels.love the product, purchased this for my brother, he had already gotten one for christmas.Well the item didn't work how it said it would. The picture was black and scrambled at best.Long story short, I got it home pluged it in, Works Great. I bought this one because it is what my Cable Company recommended.I wear my iPod while running and the left earbud keeps falling out.  Would be nice to have something better than the earbuds provided.Great Product, Could Have A Better "Pop-Up Block" System, Otherwise, It's Still A Great Product!!!$499 was the best price I found anywhere with free delivery. Works as promised. Easy assembly, started on the first pull.This IPod works great.  Purchased the item as a gift for a electronic knowledgable(Geek).  He loved it.  I got much praise.I love these headphones.  Combined with the Sound Blaster X-Fi, it gives me the best sound I've ever heard from my PC.  Really great value for someone looking for a first set of above average headphones.I pre-ordered this item, but now when i look at "My Account" the order is not listed.  Apparently, Amazon has cancelled my order without even notifying me.  I didn't even receive an e-mail.This unit skipped while sitting still in my driveway. Returned it for a refund.Owned this camera approx 14 months, minimally used. Now have infamous "lens cap error," I was unable to record my son's first Christmas, and am dealing with the worst customer service I've ever encountered.  STAY AWAY!the unit worked great for about a three-four months...then everything started going downhill.  First, the cd player stopped playing regularly [essentially, it was hit or miss when you hit the play button]. The second thing to go was the radio tuner...the stations we did recieve [which weren't that many anyway] began to fade more and more. Finally the cd player ceased working altogether and would not even release the cd's still in the tray. Seriously, this unit is terrible.The person who gave it bad reviews must have gotten a bad one as mine is outstanding""It plays dvds very well and it records better than anything else i have seen.i tried a panasonic first and it was horrible""i returned it and got the jvc.I agree with bradley,its a fine recorder.It records in 4 hour mode very good and sp mode is excellent"'Highly recommended.Works great, sleek! Speedy shipping. Tiny size. MUCH better than my earlier Kingston that broke in 3 months. Would buy again. Great price.No instructions, tried combinations of driver settings, never got a picture. Better to choose something else...Tried it in two different cars, same result. Even though I replaced with the exact 1/2 amp fuse, it blows as soon as I plug in. I even checked the voltage to make sure it was at 12 volts.We bought the Elementary Advantage 2007 - cannot even load it- we agree w/ the above. Amazon shouldn't even attempt to sell this product.I bought these to replace some terrible Sony earbuds and these are even worse than those. 1. Sound quality is terrible. Bass is decent, but the treble is completely muffled. 2. They do fit pretty well. 3. The cord seems flimsy. I'm going to search again for better earbuds.....I used to have one.   Like all Dell Products, it was easy broken (it overheated) and had to be replaced.  Dell took forever, tried charging me, etc.   Ended up wasting countless hours and money for a cheaper laptop.  Find a better brand than Dell and it would be great.Terrible program. Always in your face, kind of like windows does but even worse. Just want to install and forget, not have to interface with every day. Really slowed down the computer. Even uninstalling this app took unbelievably long. Norton really seems to make their apps way more complicated than necessary.It's interesting how people can see such a positive as a negative.   The fact that Quicken no longer supports QIF is excellent because it's going to force the remaining institutions that no longer support it, to provide the much easier to use Direct Connect or the less easy (but still preferable to QIF) Web Connect.This charger stopped working after about 3 days. Very disappointing. I guess that saying about getting what you pay for is true. Oh well. It seemed to be poorly constructed too. Would I buy it again? Not unless it came with a warranty.Ink hog Paper jammer First Tray 2 (optional)I received was defective (slider broken) Second Tray 2 I received(I use for 11x17) won't feed On warranty, HP sent a reconditioned printer - wouldn't even start I'm on printer #3 (new this time), and am getting ready to send it back Have never seen a worse computer-related product from a reputable manufacturer.Excellent printer and ink.   It uses less ink than my previous Epson.  Great print quality, clear and no smudging, even on cheap paper.Mine arrived, tried to set it up, wouldn't work, called support, product is discontinued, no support available.  Asking for a refund is getting me a run-around, will probably have to enter a claim soon.Bought this old version to upgrade to 2007 version, worked fine and only cost 20% of current version. Software works ok...buy and update the sw-->then dload the update which is really 2007-->good to goHad problems with disconnects until I called tech support, waited an hour, and got help to change the level of security to one compatible with my laptop.  All seems fine now.works great, tts is a plus. slow on initial start up and slow on initial tracking, but after that fine. great poi database fast recalulateAfter much research and reviewing lots of suppliers this was my choice.  Great quality and a really good price.  Came earlier than expected which was a nice surprise.Excellent machine except it kept freezing after finalizing a disk forcing me to disconnect the machine in order to get it functioning again so I sent it back.Excellent machine except it kept freezing after finalizing a disk forcing me to disconnect the machine in order to get it functioning again so I sent it back.This is a lousy product. Cost me a bomb, and lasted 2.5 years. The screen has developed a set of horizontal lines making it almost impossible to view.This was bought as a Xmas gift.  Arrived in good condition and arrived quickly.  Unit was for an entire moderate apartment and is working OK (1 month old).Just sent back the second defective unit. Schumacher said they never recieved the first one I returned and I received the replacement a day later (their record keeping leaves a lot to be desired). The replacement was also defective! I bailed out and asked for a refund. Made in China-Beware.We purchased this thinking the Fisher-Price name would mean it was a good product.  It worked ok for the first couple of months, but then suddenly the static got really loud to the point we had to turn it all the way up to hear my daughter crying.  The static was very loud, there were often loud clicks, and our cell phones and wireless internet seemed to constantly cause loud beeping. We just purchased a Graco iMonitor and couldn't be happier.There OK Lacking a litttle clarity it the upper mids..........struggle with the low end a bit.However reseating sometimes helps. Overall there still good.Just got mine today. Returning to Amazon tommorrow. Defective. iPod stalled on select language screen. Will not respond.Just got mine today. Returning to Amazon tommorrow. Defective. iPod stalled on select language screen. Will not respond.Not the best noise canceling headphones, but if you are looking for something cheap (n not willing to pay over $200) they are quite nice.first one I got broke second day. I brought it back to apple store and they gave me a new one. Now Everything is fine.It is too slow for 200G hard disk. I have total 300 G hard disk C:/D:/E; it run over 12 hours still not finish c:I purchased this DVD expecting alot of good info,what I got was a big ripoff some guy running his gums saying nothing.I purchased 2 D70s cameras and found the instruction book to be the best help.Plzz save your money buying this DVD,get the real deal Read!!!! the instruction info book.What can I say?  It worked fine while it worked.  Then it just stopped (not jammed).  We are light users and were on maybe our third basketful.I bought this based on the reviews here. After getting the unit and trying the recommended DVD's I could not finalize DVD-R's. The DVD-RAM worked great, and I never tried the DVD-RW's. I returned the unit after creating at least 12 coasters with Memorex, and TDK DVDs.PHILIPS USB POWERED TRAVEL SPEAKERS MET THE EXPECTATION SHOWING VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE. THANKS, MAURICIO.This is great for the first 3 months maybe 4. After that they move around so much and break free from anything.i purchased these about a week ago and the headband has already cracked. dont waste your money look at a different brand.I have been using it regularly with excellent results. It has even helped me from getting lost on the trails or road.easy to install, easy to calibrate. I did not notice that much of a difference.  maybe with a higher-end monitor I would.this is a real piece of overpriced junk that started malfunctioning less than two weeks after I received it.Bad quality audio-just junk.had a recall.  But excellent customer service from Milwaukee.  New batteries shipped to me free of charge.  New batteries in excellent condition.A real plays for sure mp3,it accepts downloaded music for sure. No problems playing music,completely operational probably best bang for the buck.Setting it is not intuitive and it is easy to accidentally touch a button and throw some setting off. The time is nearly impossible to see at any angle even when I hit the snooze button to activate the weak backlight.I bought this TV years ago refurbished, still looks great and works very well.  I would definitely recommend it.It fits really well on the ears, have a great sound fidelity and the noise canceling works very well.Sound quality not good had too replace filters fast. Noise canceltion is really good volume of sound not greatThis was top rated by consumer mag. It was very to easy to set up. Everything was already loaded.It seemed difficult to get the heart rate started and then seemed to hang up on a heart rate.Great product. Plug & play right out of box. My Vista recognized it immediately and was transferring files qiuckly.I thought Costco had the best prices.  I was wrong.  Great price and great service.  I will be back!The phototent works great however replacement bulbs are very hard to find. Once the bulbs burn out good luck!The assembly is too clumsy to handle(too many pieces). Beats the purpose of having a flat/thin display. Bulkier versions like c330 or 550 are much better. Slow in acquiring satellites and recalculations but generally decent value for moneyYou really have to work at getting a good fit on these. I tried all the shapes and sizes provided but never got them to stay in place for very long unless I really pushed them into my ears which was quite uncomfortable. These only provide good sound when you manage to get them to fit really snugly in your ear, otherwise they are very tinny. In the end I found these required way too much effort to try and get to work well and I regret buying them.I bought it in last October last year for $80. 6 month later, Ethernet port quit, and customer service from Motorola said sine USB port still functions, they can't repair it. Then another 6 month later, USB port quit all the sudden. Now it's completely gone.Bought this for my son cos his toshiba SD-P 2600 broke.  I like the picture but disappointed with the sound. Pros:  Big screen, nice picture.  Plays most type of CDs. Con:  Audio.  Sounds really bad.Although the controls are not intuitive, requiring actually to READ the MANUAL, the sound quality is good, and I've already got 4 albums on it with no sign of filling up...I'm pretty happy with it.This model received high ratings when we looked around at several sites in early 2005 so we decided to buy it.  What a mistake.  It's a pain to copy vhs to dvd with menus.  Very confusing.  First problem was the unit freezing during recording.This should have given us a hint.  Next, DVDs would stop playing mid-movie - they would get stuck and we would have to forward several frames to be able to continue the movie.  Now, it doesn't even recognize DVDs anymore. We just dumped it today.  Not even going to bother paying to get it fixed - we bought a new non-Samsung model.Getting an Olevia fixed is nearly impossible.  They have NO authorized service centers according to their tech service guy!!!!  Of course I don't think he is even in the USA!!!  So what else is new.I preferred my good old fashioned Finale, but I can't use that anymore, so this is a reasonable substitute.The item itself appears to be a beefy, well designed mount.  My problem is, after 11 years of ordering, with Amazon. This item had the wrong parts shipped with it, was partially opened, and scratched!  It pretty much looked like I had received someone else's returned item. I would give Amazon one star but gave two stars for the ease of returning. Update: Amazon sent new item. Perfect condition, good product. (unable to update review to 4 or 5 stars)The item itself appears to be a beefy, well designed mount.  My problem is, after 11 years of ordering, with Amazon.

Not even enough light to help under kitchen cabinets or over stove.  A complete waste of money. The review option didn't allow me to give the Sylvania DOT LED light a NO star rating.product was received defective.  I was unable to reach anyone to speak to live regarding options of return and replacement.  after numerous tries I rec'd email back saying Amazon was unable to offer replacement- still not able to speak with anyone live.  I wound up sending unit back - still waiting for credit and finding replacement at anither site for less money with great customer service.  Very unhappy with Amazon customer service.Wires are too short...could not get the desired separation of the sattelites. Sounds good enough though.dont have to rent or buy dvd movies anymore Better than a DVD player and bluyraysGreat purchase...great sound for the money.  Very portable, easy to use...best purchase I've made in awhile.it was a bit bigger than i expected it to be , but otherwise its perfect.Product was a great price - shipped and recieved in good time - works just fine.One of my great investments ever... radio signal went great!!! i thought it was going to be bad, but it turned out to be great... im gettin another one for my brother...The ink is good. Obviously the cartridges are going to work. If only they lasted longer.I purchased this TV three years ago. This LCD has provided excellent performance since. Highly recommend.The light is weaker than I wanted. The batteries don't last as long as I wanted.great add-ons and great pics. I'm not sure why the all black is a premium cost?I purchased this TV three years ago. This LCD has provided excellent performance since. Highly recommend.This is very cute, very easy to set-up and very easy to read!  I love it.Amozon.com gave me a good price, fast shipping and will buy from them in the futureMade a lot of difference during overseas travel!  Easy to use and easy on the back.Don't expect this to substitute for one you may already have. You will have to change the usb receiver as well.  I really wanted a battery, unable to find,  ordered another..expensive battery.Don't expect this to substitute for one you may already have. You will have to change the usb receiver as well.  I really wanted a battery, unable to find,  ordered another..expensive battery.Have tried other inks with at best average results . Can't do better then OEM product.They sounded great for the one day that they worked.  I had a few problems getting them to fit in my ear correctly, but once they were in, the sound was pretty good.  Unfortunately, after less than a day of use, the left ear bud went dead.  How disappointing!  They are going back to Amazon for a refund...I'll spend my money on another brand.I placed orders twice and received confirmation. A few days later, the order was cancelled. First order: Amazon said might be problem with my credit card, then later said it was actually cancelled by the vendor. Second order: Again cancelled a few days after the order was confirmed.Received DVD's damaged due to inproper packaging by the vendor. Vendor refused to exchange damaged discs.what can i say about logitech. they are doing great job. these speakers are really sexy.Cheap selector round mechanical thing............it would be better if it was all flat like a nanoI constantly dropped this thing or my niece would and it didn't break I finally upgraded to an mp3 player and gave it away It worked great while I had it never had any troubleI would highly recommend this modem.  Very easy to set up and I saw a dramatic speed increase over my old RCA.Received product with no user manual. Purchased item so could transfer my wife's personal recipe book from an older version. New version fails to recognize the older version, as advertised. Requested technical support on line twice. Have never had a response.I live in an APT 3 miles from broadcast center (NYC). Only receive two channel with snow. Maybe there are two many high-rise buildings. Returned.Nice features, on/off switch is nice.  AA batteries last long.  Sometimes not smooth tracking, though.  Almost would be more practical paying less for a wired mouse that works smoothly.This product doesn't record well. Constantly prompts to format discs that have (by some miracle) been successfully recorded.  You get what you pay for.  Invest in a better product.Simply doesn't work 25 feet away and through one wall.  Like listening to AM radio in 1971.  Static.  Static... Static... Don't waste your money. I have thrown it away.Works well, is slightly bulky as are all big external hard drives ... power button can be a pain sometimes but never a major issue. Would recommend to all.I had severals mp3 players and i must say iPod rules!! And iPod Video is great! great screen, great sound quality, great design. Simply the best device i have.The various time functions are well thought-out...Too, the large and well lit display is fine. Radio reception i poor, worse than previous, much less costly clock radios I've had.These earbuds have great sound quality....but they stop working after a month   or so.  First the left one went out and shortly after the right one did the same.I think I ordered this too late.  My daughter was already 3 months old.  It's kind of confusing what hooks into where.  I ended up using a blanket instead.We returned a competing product.  This label maker - although requiring additional downloads and info from Dymo (which we obtained prior to ordering) - works with Mac and the Mac contacts.  Thankfully.I got this for Chirstmas, and it started out great. Then, about 8 months later, it stopped working. I'm planning on getting an iPod insted of this crappy thing.I was not aware until purchasing, that the U3 Smart Drive by Kingston would not run just any software but only certain programs therefore it is mostly useless to me.  However I will use it as a general back up thumb drive.Excellent product, it had already used before it it is high-grade, the software can be changed freely.These lites are nit that great.  I bought them to go under my cabinets and they have poor lighting!!!!These lites are nit that great.  I bought them to go under my cabinets and they have poor lighting!!!!Was easy to load on my new PC and has worked without issue.Great card. Works well. Fast and Cheap. What else could you ask for?Excellent inks       for an excellent printer  Canon.     Too bad they are so expensive.The light is handy and rather bright, but the adhesive that came on the light does not hold it in place for long. I ended up putting double sided tape on the back to use it over my sink.The light is handy and rather bright, but the adhesive that came on the light does not hold it in place for long. I ended up putting double sided tape on the back to use it over my sink.Quite acceptable.  In line with prior purchases at outlet where PIXMA was soldI can't say much about the unit because it came to me dead.It suddenly stops working after a few uses, I lost all Data Stored..This torch does all I expected it to do. Product is as described and shipped promptly. Works great and looking forward to many hours of use.Easiest GPS to use Ever right out of the box it totally RocksVery well made mount. Easy to install, need two people to hang TV.I bought this drive less than a year ago.  It has already crashed.Seems reasonably good. However, still rather expensive. Can't use 3rd party refills and results slightly less bright than my Pixma 4000. Overall, I am reasonably happy.It worked great for about a week.  Then it got stuck on the start up screen.  I've sent it back and haven't got the refund yet...NO SERVICE. CALLED SEVERAL TIMES FOR HELP WITH NO ADECQUATE RESPONSE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS FOR A NEW USER. I DECIDED TO DELETE DE PROGRAM INSTEAD.Works fine as advertised, but I actually don't really use it much.  Probably better things out there in same price range, but it's an OK performer.I really liked the convenience of ordering online, but the yellow cartridge triggers an error frequently when it pops out of the tray; frustrating and disappointing.I bought these to workout with.  They serve that purpose well.  Not great, but I would buy again, or seek out a similar pair if available.I bought these to workout with.  They serve that purpose well.  Not great, but I would buy again, or seek out a similar pair if available.Fell in love with this camera first time I tried it.  Easy to use, colors are great!  Ordered telephoto lens to get the really great pictures.  Love it!!!   Amazon is great too, always a pleasure to deal with !!I'm completely satisfied.  My runs have improved w/this watch.  I totally recommend it.Good sound. Easy to use. Even my 76 year old mother wants one.Excellent product, easy to use, great sound, perfect size, and plenty of memory.Save cash and still get a printer that works...easy setup...just plug it in!Even when the directions are followed carefully, it constantly overflows. Unless you like cleaning milk and coffee off your stove, I'd stay away from this one. For the price, I expected much much better. A complete waste of money.This is a great mp3 player.  Great price. User friendly and sounds great.I bought this one after after reading all the nice reviews here. But the item simply doesn't work. I was unable to transfer songs after a certain limit. The voice recorder wasn't functioning. To add to this, it gets stuck quite often. Anyway I returned this faulty piece without losing a penny.I bought this cpu to replace my Duron. Realy good for budget desktop.Black / yellow print head failed twice -- getting customer support to send me a new one was a lengthy and tedious process -- so much in fact that the second time it failed I didnt even bother -- I just paid the $79.  Clearly more cost effecting than submitting to the 2 hour long 'do this do that' routine.  Paper handling is awful -- constantly skips pages.  Almost out of ink on all cartridges and then it is going in the ole dumpster.I received this MP3 player as a gift in December 2006...three months later it has completely stopped working. Sure Sandisk is going to replace my broken player, but I really don't want to use a player that obviously doesn't last longer than three months. Their product support website is terrible as well and their customer service agents are nearly useless...I will never buy another Sandisk product and caution you to avoid this company as well.It's a nice light. Feature to take change the battery could be better.It's a nice light. Feature to take change the battery could be better.nice i bought it for a birthday gift great price nice buy my niece loved itCorsair is known for quality. Spend a bit more if you want the best. Nuff said.Easy to install and structure is sound and capable of holding 32 inch flat screen LCDThis product is made from quality materials and performs as advertised. It was easy to assemble.I hate this thing. One of the worst purchases I've ever made. Can't even handle ONE peice of paper without jamming. After struggling with it for months, I finally threw mine in the dumpster today, and came online to warn anyone else away from this. I'll never buy a Fellowes product again.This is an unbelievably bad thing to buy.  There are so many bad things about it, it is hard to know where to begin...Perhaps the beginning.  Nightmare installation software that warns it can hurt the operating system.  Battery that will not hold a charge even when plugged into cigarette lighter.  Technical support from Calcutta that never once would just answer the most basic questions.  e.g.  Are you breathing?  Please hold sir, while I check into that.  Really bad.This tele converter lens is good for the price, works well on the Canon S5 series.I registered the product to get the regular updates.  Now I continuously get a message popping up that an update is available.  When I try to get the update, I get a message that I am not authorized to receive updates.  I log out and log in several times, and once in awhile, I will get the update. I regret replacing Norton with this piece of garbage.  Mcafee has gone down hill.  I will eventually get annoyed enough to just uninstall the Mcafee and go back to Norton.Great product, but going for less than $50 elsewhere. I just bought one at MacMall for 49 dollars. It's a close-out item that is available for *much* cheaper than what I could find here on Amazon.Sitespinner is easy to use, intuitive, and really thorough (it can do pretty much anything you want). I downloaded a trial and bought within a day.Nothing else to say really. The device broke right after the warranty expired. Great while it lasted but will never trust Apple againbest purchase I ever made.  It is a product I would recommend to anyone. Easy to use and the pictures are scanned perfect.Two days after receiving this player, it stopped playing MP3 files,  we just got an annoying buzz.  I've returned it for a refund.I received a bad copy from adorama.com today. I was really disappointed because I had great expectations from adorama.com..I'm sending it back today.I love this product, I got it right before I went on vacation and I just kept taking pictures...still have tons of room.The best product I have ever bought for my iPod, make sure your iPod is already scratch and lint free before applying though!We never received this item.  I e-mailed the Rainbor group but never received a reply.  I will never order anything through them again.I am still trying to wrestle w/this while starting up my new consulting business.  I have asked wife to get into it an "make if work if possible"......  I was bummed to find it for $20 cheaper at Costco the day it arrived in my mail.The first time I washed this item the elastic around the edges stretched out completely and now doesn't stay on the changing pad!Returned after about 3 weeks.  Nano Plus locked up and tech support confirmed the item was defective.  They do not make Creative Labs products like they used to!  I have several older Creative Labs MP3 players that still work fine.  They used to make great products, NOW, in my opinion, cheaply made and sub-standard.I originally paid $250 at Best Buy for a similar product and decided to go online to see if I could find a better buy.  What a difference it made.  I ended up returning the best buy wall mount and purchased this one and it was very easy to install as well.  Great product, great price!I really liked the first one I bought, but after 6mo it died. It would only work with a USB plugged into my car radio. Would not work w/ headphones. Wouldn't even play. Blue screen wouldn't even come on. I thought it was a fluke....bought another...same prob after 4mo. Spend more or buy a different product!I was excited about these little lights thinking they would provide a bit of light when I first come into my apt (its pretty dark).  The adhesive didn't work well at all. I kept finding the lights on the floor when I returned home.  If the adhesive worked it would be such a nice little light!I was excited about these little lights thinking they would provide a bit of light when I first come into my apt (its pretty dark).  The adhesive didn't work well at all. I kept finding the lights on the floor when I returned home.  If the adhesive worked it would be such a nice little light!Great sound quality Easy to set up Excellent price! Doesnt get much better than that does it?  This thing has all of those.  Im actually thinking about getting another one for the office.Best gate we've seen on the market.Spent many months researching and trying to fit my almost six foot opening that drops down to stairs.My baby can see but not get thru it.Highly reccommended.I found this very easy to set up and get started.  The quality of image isn't great and you want to make sure there's plenty of light available or it really gets dark.Not very user friendly, still trying to figure out how to get things downloaded onto it a month later. Ipod was much easier, got my son started downloading on it without a problem.This is a good space saving rack. It holds more than I expected and was pretty easy to put together. It's not very fancy, but, the price is right and it looks good.I got this at my baby shower almost a year ago. I loved it when I first started using it, but lately (almost 10 months later), it barely gets reception and is always staticky. I am now in the market for a new monitor. It was really good at the beginning but just didn't last.The display on the cordless stopped working after a few months. After contacting Motorola several times, they finally sent a replacement unit. This replacement has now stopped working as well and Motorola is refusing to replace it. Don't buy this unit, spend your money on a better quality product from a different company.the Garmin is pretty cool. Haven't used it on particularly difficult travel but we look forward to seeing how it helps us negotiate.Unit arrived broken - appeared to be a repackaged return.  Something was lose and rattling inside the unit. To be fair, I never tried the unit as it appeared damaged.It worked once when first connected and then it self destructed. I get nothing but static. Static on every station option. Static on every IPOD setting. This FM Transmitter is a big, big disappointment.Sturdy construction, well placed compartments and pockets. Zippers are nylon/plastic and hold well without getting stuck. I regularly carry approx 20-30 lbs without strain.so i got these earbuds about 2 days after i ordered, thank u amazon. they were awesome, completely sound blocking, great sound (atleast better than my apple headphones) the only problem was that i like to listen to my music loud sometimes, and these headphones wont handle it. my left earbud stopped making sound while the right was too quiet. luckily there is a great warranty... just goes to show you, dont throw away the warranty information =////// (real nice price too)Product worked as advertised. Had major problem taking about 3 & 1/2 hours to correct. Installed over IS 2005. Took time with Norton to figure out how to get rid of 2005 because it kept saying my subscription had expired not letting get security service. Got to Norton help OK.great idea but not enough light for under cabinet lighting.I just see my first movie last week in this new device. Looks very good. Excellent sound and video quality.great idea but not enough light for under cabinet lighting.Weak signal, doesn't do the job I bought it for.Very easy to use, BUT the sound quality is so bad that I can't listen to anything louder than Easy Listening. I wish I had my old FM transmitter back.This is an excellent router. Easy to install. Works great.Great product, the sound is as good as much more expensive models i've tried in the past. Next time i'm in the market for earphones I'l probably get the same.a little loose but otherwise works great, very good soundThese component cables are very well made and work great.Arrived four business days after I ordered it. Installed it without issue. Works as advertised. Can't ask for much more.The memory card was received well packaged and in good condition. The product was as advertised and a good value.This imem has many nice features.  The constant "new message" light is irritating, but the battery back-up and ability to receive calls even during an electrical outage is very nice.All, Okay for the money, however my cap never stays on, which is probably not good long term. U3 software is okay, but nothing to write home about. / BrianPain to configure.  Flaky connection at best.  When I removed the software, I got a user interface failure (RtGina2.dll failed to load) which was rather annoying to have to fix.Good price for this ink.  But the boxes keep arriving really crinkled; yet, the ink cartridges appear to be okay.Logical controls,FM arial not quite good enough for weak stations. Audio quality accurate; coud be better but that would raise the price beyond feasibility (Bose costs $500+). A good buy.the microwave is really good, and it got right on time, before I expected actually. It's bigger than I though, and very easy to use. The design is very nice.Well, Panasonic seems to be the cordless of choice. For the price, others cant touch the quality. I used to spend my money on the really cheap cordless phones, but even after charging them properly, they would die all too soon. After talking to many sales people they all recommended the Panasonic. Its easy to use and full of useful options. Calling to receive messages remotely is a snap, plus you can listen to messages from the handset instead of the base if need be. Go buy this - you wont be disappointed.great price.....great product. Even out in Montana where there isn't a whole lot of landmarks but was able to travel around without getting lost.  ThanksIf you have a laptop I heartly advise you get one! Cheaper tha buying a new Laptop GeorgeGreat price at 30.00 lots of space, too bad this blue doesn't look "trendy" hmmm... maybe it's time to go back to school.Loved the price, size, styling. But apparent weak workmanship. Couldn't get power. Batteries, except for 1 fresh set for about 1 minute, never worked after I tried 4 fresh sets. The cover for the batteries remains a bit loose, enough that there's no power. For that 1 minute, it worked fine with my Bluetooth-equipment laptop. Sorry Kensington. I'm returning it.We find this product often has trouble reading CDs (both purchased and burned CD-Rs).  It'll stop playing for minutes at a time and you'll hear it spinning up and down as it tries to read. Pretty disappointing.I wish I hadn't trusted the Amazon Ink Finder and checked myself, because (as stated in many other reviews), the black ink in this package does not fit the MX700. Now I'm stuck without ink. Not acceptable.I don't know if Amazon got a shipment of these, but I ordered two (returned the first one then got a replacement) and the second one was blank too. I wonder if anyone else had this problem.I purchased the "Skip DR" in hopes of repairing my daughter's scratched DVD's.  Too bad I'll never know if this product works.  The first one I bought, malfunctioned.  Somehow, after putting in 6 NEW batteries, the wheel was turning rather slow. Little did I realize my batteries exploded.  I returned the product and exchanged it (Giving it the benefit of the doubt).  The second one was no better.  Another 6 new batteries and the wheel barely turned halfway before ejecting my disc and turning off.  Boy do I wish I read the previous review before buying this.  I will be returning this yet again, and I think I'll stick to manual.Piece of junk.... so much static and worse performance of several FM transmitters that I tried. After reading several reviews and quite a bit of online research, bought this from Amazon. The performance was dismal. It was so sensitive that moving hand closer to the transmitter would result in static. Tried on my 2 cars (SAAB and Nissan) and the performance was equally bad. Returned to Amazon and got my refund... Don't count on it and try something else.Great job converting LP's to CD's.  Took a while to get the hang of it but it works well.  Found that leaving the default settings was best.  Later, the music could be tweaked for specific sound requirements.Bought 3 for my kids at my local Toys R Us after seeing this online at Amazon. Luckily I tried them before Christmas morning (after reading a bad review posted here). After fully charging, the first one started fine and played a movie for about 12 minutes, then the screen went black (and never came back). The second one only played sound (no picture), and the third worked great for the 30 minutes I tried it. I took all three back and got a refund (I couldn't afford to take a chance on the good one going bad on the second movie). My question: Doesn't Toys R Us test this crap before they put it on their shelves?Still the best simple GPS. Has Mp3 player and holds pix but hardly ever used. Great for the price.Impossible to use while running..  You'll have your fingers on it forever trying for it to read your pulse...  probably would work for a less strenious activity.This pathetic printer wend bad after just 20 pages.  First the black color came out only in stripes, then disappeared completely.  Like a fool, I spent $35+ to buy a new black ink cartridge (which won't fit a better printer), only to find that the real problem was internal and could not be fixed.Retractable cable is a good feature for use, but the sound quality is not good enough. You may hear additional noise, not apparently, but it is there.Easy to use. Battery life is decent. Earbuds are decent quality. Armband and clear case are great for working out, running, and even working in the yard.Poorly written user manual make this a difficult product to use unless you are very tech savy. Great features, unit is very light and comfortable to wear.My first venture into falsh drives. Had been using external Iomega drive. This is great. Easy to use, portable and accurate. Highly recommend for use saving anything.The first fan received did not work. A coll to Amazon got a replacement immediately, postage paid both ways. The new fan was all that I expected.Easy set up. Get the friction stand. You can easily move into any vehicle. Modern tech at its best.I love this heart monitor.  It is precise and never gives me problems.  Since I started using it a month ago I have lost almost 10 lbs.Worked really great for 372 days, then it died. At first I thought it might be a loose connection since it was buzzing, but no luck on that front.  I even swapped to a different cable, reset the receiver setting, etc. but no luck.  The auto-detect feature that turns it on when detecting a signal still works (light turns green), but no sound comes out no matter what the volume setting.This is a good MP3 player - FM works well (I use it in India), the music is played well. Interface is great as well. Only issue is that if you switch between playing MP3 to FM and then come back to MP3 it forgets the last location and starts from scratch. Some form of storing your current location would be good. Anyway for the price it is a good buy.The reviews i read before purchasing this item really helped. i concur, it's REALLY good and easy to set up.This product was defective and never worked properly. It wanted us to turn left when right was appropriate. The directions popped up and were easy to use so I think if the product was working properly, it would be a great buy. We sent ours back and chose another brand.I bought this in 2005, long before my first mp3 player.  It was a nice little cd player and worked well until last year, when I made the mistake of putting a scratched CD inside it.  All of a sudden, it spun the disk very slowly.  After that happened, it never worked again - just kept spinning any disk I put in it really slowly and the display will eventually read 'no disc'.  Just now I tried using it again with fresh batteries and there is this snapping noise along with the super slow disk spinning. Anyway, it was great while it lasted.  The controls on the front were kind of awkward and inconvenient but it had nice features and sounded okay.I bought this in 2005, long before my first mp3 player.

But the promised $50 rebate was missing.Excellent value, easy to set up. Picture clarity, depth  and color almost give you a 3-D effect.I love this product.. great picture, great sound, easy to use. It was perfect for the price.Works great...it is compact, yet feels fairly sturdy.  It has handled multiple devices connected without any problems~sadly :-< Get one of those cigarette lighter adaptor thingys instead, got one and it works great.Received it when I was told it will get here.  Easy to install.  Also received rebate already!!!!The user interface needs getting used to, but otherwise it gets you to where you are going.Great wall mount, I highly recommend this product. It is very sturdy, easy to install and can't even be seen once installed. Great price too. I used it on a 20 inch Vizio tv.The product arrived in great condition, on time and just what we ordered! Great job! Great seller!I thought this product would be cheap and ugly, its not and it sounds great! Highly recommend.good cooker, very functional, works well, been using it for a year and never had a problem.Worst product ever manufactured. No back light for clock radio poor quality sound. alarm does not work properly.  and hard to find the talk button when phone rings.  Send back to R&D for upgrades!!!!!I can't actually review the product. I just bought a printer and ordered spare ink as well.This product is very easy to install and the shipper made sure I recieved it in time.Works fairly well.  The display is very disappointing and hard to read if you are over 45.still reading the manual.seems like a good device to record training sessions but not very user friendly.Printer is an ink guzzler, never prints the colors right -- even with proper cartridges and cleaning/maintenance. Scanner is average at best. All functions are very slow. An expensive, bad buy. Definitely not recommended.Works exactly as advertised. I found the button slightly stiff, however, it's quite handy in my closet.Works exactly as advertised. I found the button slightly stiff, however, it's quite handy in my closet.The USB Flash Drive was easy to install into a spare USB port at the back of the computer.  Windows recognized, installed and made the USB Flash Drive available immediately.  Moving data around with this device is as simple as removing the USB Flash Drive from the USB port and plugging the USB Flash Drive into another computers USB port. Pros: Continues to work very well. Cons: None.Very effective callibration device, particularly helpful for flat screen monitors; wonderful quality at a very fair price.The router is an excellent linksys product that was available at Amazon at a very attractive price.I got the product earlier than promised, which is always a good thing, and with no problems.The Webcam is good.  I was especting more, better image and a bigger focus area and clarity.My sansa sandisk m230 isn't even a month old and is already broken. It worked wonderfully at first but yesterday it got stuck on the finalizing screen. Sansa customer service stinks so its basically $35 down the drain. I ordered a creative zen to replace this one instead of going for another sansa. DON"T BUY THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!I Am using it with a D-Link DNS-321 network server having (2) 1TB drives. PROS: Well made. Real easy to set up. CONS: Finicky about how some AVI files are ripped. I do recommend this product. Works quite well.Sound transmission not very clear - lots of static. I live and work around the metropolitan Orlando, Florida area. I returned the product several days after receiving it. Purchased another type with limited channels(8)from Radio Shack that works much better.Received info in mail from Pantone so figured I would try it...using it turned my grays to pinkish and couldnt control that changing light sensor.  But it was cheap so I didn't lose sleep.  Was frustrated enough to return it.The sound was good but the headset design was poor. Product broke after 2 days of wearing.Have been using NAV for quite a few years, with reasonable performance (not great, but ok).  Recently updated to NAV2006, and voila, constant system freezes, constant BSOD's, sometimes cannot even reboot the machine.  Ran the web-based Symantec uninstaller, and system is completely rock-solid stable again.  Needless to say, I am no longer a NAV user.We purchased these for under cabinet lighting in our kitchen. They look good, but the light just isn't nearly bright enough for accent lighting.  They work great, just not what we were hoping for.We purchased these for under cabinet lighting in our kitchen. They look good, but the light just isn't nearly bright enough for accent lighting.  They work great, just not what we were hoping for.I bought this after reading the reviews. I wanted an upgrade to my current, cheaper RCA antenna. I didn't get a single channel, even thought I can get about 8 channels with my much cheaper antenna. I will be returning this one. I had to give it one star, but really didn't want to give it any stars.Excellent program with many features like owning a real aquarium.The only catch is going to the website to get additional fish, etc....I still want a trigger fishMy headphones fell apart the first time I used them and I had to glue all the foam pieces back together.  The sound quality was just okay, but I would spend more money next time and get a better quality headphone.It really is amazing when you put these on first, and then flip the switch and see how much noise is gone. Not a perfect silence like for the neighbor's lawn mower where you can still hear it but muffled considerably.I ordered this monitor in early April.  I kept getting messages from Amazon that it was delayed.  A month passed and I got another message from Amazon.  I went to their website and it said the product was shipping immediately.  But, mine was still delayed.  I decided to order it again, and cancel the original order.  It was shipped immediately!  When I got it, though, it was shipped in an open box that looked like it had been dropped from a second story window.  I notified Amazon and they sent another, right away.  The monitor is great, but the buying experience sucked.After receiving it, tray does not open. Customer service tried to help, but had to send it for repair. Warranty specifies repair or refurbished model, which I do not like at all so would have prefered to get the money back, but more than 30 days passed since purchased. Guess Japanese Panasonic is better than "made in Singapore" This cannot happen in a brand new DVD recorder, probably last Panasonic product I purchase. Suggest Amazon gives extended money back warranty for this kind of "big" failures, like receiving a brand new DVD and tray does not even open to insert the disk.After receiving it, tray does not open.

The Mono sound was poor and the picture wasn't too great, I mean $39.87 should be enough for a great VCR. Well, I plan on taking it back and getting a refund, so I can get a different VCR like a MAGNAVOX.Received the item 5 weeks ago. So far working fine. Ordered it through Amazon thinking the annual shipping membership with Amazon helps by ordering from Amazon.  At the end of ordering process realized that additional $8+ shipping payment is required as the item is not directly from Amazon.  On top of it, unlike Amazon's prompt shipping; it took about/over a week to receive the poduct.The program went in to several hangs while trying to install. I used Task Manager to proceed further. Once installed and all "Green" for ok, I tried using it. I teach college mathematics online, and am constantly opening and closing multiple student Word files. Norton Security slowed my Word to an absolute crawl so it became unuseable. I have to diasable Norton Security when working!!!I received (2) defective Garmin 350's.  The first unit was totally hosed!  The second unit went belly-up after 6 hours of use.  Garmin informed me thet second unit was a reconditioned model, Amazon stated it was new.  Amazon paid for the shipping of both units back and gave me a full refund, however I am now without a GPS!blown away by amazon's desire to provide good service but even after replacing system one speaker still has hissing noise. putting that aside, i have enjoyed using the system.seldom use it, yet the LCD screen broken within 3 months. Called the customer service, the worst customer service I even met. I was asked to send a picture of broken MP3 to them. Sent 4 times they still can not get it. Decide to give up. Won't buy any sandisk product anymore.I should have trusted my instincts and gone with the Sony set instead of this piece of junk!! The picture on this set is not that great and I love the feature of this set that causes the screen to black out for a second whenever bright lights flash across the screen. Philips suggested using the HDMI connection instead of using the component cables. After spending $100 on HDMI cables the problem persisted. I ended up selling the POS on ebay and buying the Sony set. This is the first and last Philips product I will EVER buy. Caveat Emptor everybody!!!I've got no complaints with mine. good all around and feel good on the head for very long periods of time. I often forget i'm wearing them after music stops.Like jsut about everything else Bose sells these are way overpriced.  The Sennheiser PCX250's sound much better and cost less than half as much.It them forever to process my order, like a good 5 days.  For some reason the shipping got lost and they didn't know about it, until I emailed after like 2 weeks I ordered it.  But they sent me a new one with 2 days shipping right away.This router has worked correctly from the moment I opened the box. Very easy user set up. Signal is excellent all throughout my home.Great mount, great value. Easy to install and works just like it is supposed to. I would recommend to anyone considering a wall mount.I bought ten MP3 players for junior and high school kids.  They liked it very much.  I have not heard any complaints.  Great price.Using as a second vacuum cleaner.  Basically, I got what I paid for; only have carpeting in three bedrooms, so don't need great unit.The Go Video VR3840 worked fine for a few months but now it plays some discs while not playing other discs (even ones that it played fine a couple of months ago).  It seems the engineers have constructed it just to work well until the warranty is up.i suppose it works for what it is. but the FM frequency still tries to scramble itself in sometimes which can be quite annoying.The speaker has good sound but the first one I got was defective and the second one was missing accessories. Company help line was a long wait and no help.  Fortunately amazon.com was great and replaced defective speaker. I still don't have accessories.The speaker has good sound but the first one I got was defective and the second one was missing accessories. Company help line was a long wait and no help.  Fortunately amazon.com was great and replaced defective speaker. I still don't have accessories.This Web Cam does not have any low light quality at all, I have several cheaper webcams that have MUCH better low light quality.  I would not suggest anyone buying this cam for settings where lighting is not Extremely bright.Bought this based on reviews, looking for something to play both CDs and my ipod, sound w/ ipod is pretty good, but radio stations sound tinny, and cds not much better.i live about 30 miles away from the hdtv broadcasting towers. using this antenna, i have been able to receive all of the hdtv stations in picture perfect condition. highly recommended.Easy to install and worked great for my 32" LCD.  In fact liked it so much I bought another.  Best price online with Free shipping.  Doesn't get any better than this.THIS PRODUCTS WORKS GREAT FOR THE PRICE... THIS IS MY SECOND ON AND THE SCREWS KEEP GOING UN DONE... NO BIG DEAL... BUT THEY WORK GREAT AND WILL KEEP BUYING ITTransmitter is too weak. Transmission can be easily overcome by transmitters in vehicles passing by. Ugly long antenna line. Went out and bought a Griffin transmitter which has much more power.WARNING: Unreliable. Stopped working after just three months. At $29, cost was nearly $10/mo plus electricity for a very dim light. For the most expensive light bulb I've ever bought, I expected more. Average bulb life 60,000 hours??? I got about 240 hours out of it at most.I almost got this item on eBay but then found it even cheaper here on Amazon. Same product for a fraction of the price. Works great and never fails me. Great range in remote controll I must say.Had it for 2 days and features/picture were great.  Then suddenly screen turns green, and the unit started powering off and switching channels randomly for a while.  After a couple of hours, it died completely. What a pity.Replacement filter works well.  Tends to form a bit of mold and musty smell if left sitting in water while humidifier is not running.  I suggest always running your humidifier completely out of water before shutting it off.Liked the features, nice quality picture, but had extreme problems with the DVD drawer. The drawer always gets stuck - not smooth moving in and out - and eventually the DVD would reject all disks (would try to read them and spit them out 99% of the time). Looking to replace this item. Stay away!Well after my first one started turning itself off and requiring unplugged rest time before it would come back on I called Samsung.  They shipped me a refurbished replacement and it worked for four days.  Now it won't display anything.  On to replacement number two...The product does what it says, though I am still having a hard time moving as a single set a group of notes that is many pages long.  I purchased this instead of the Logitech pen because I wanted to be able to use any legal pad rather than specially purchased ones.Based on the rave reviews I saw on Amazon below I bought and installed Kaspersky AV Persona 5.0. 1)On the plus side, it found several Trojan horse programs and deleted them. 2)On the huge negative side I can no longer run Internet Explorer (blank window opens and then shuts), nor can I use Windows Media player, same thing happens. 3)Another big negative -No support! I emailed support telling them of my problems but received no reply. If I can uninstall this thing, I will go back to Norton or McAffe.I have had great experience with this printer.  I even bought a jet direct card for it, and and it works great.  I recently installed XP 64-bit only to find there were no drivers for this printer supported.  However, I used the HP4L driver and it works good enough for my purposes.I brought the navigator in March 2006. It served me well till now. The black and white display is low on energy consumption. Initially getting used to "keep-right" (sometimes meaning drive straight ahead) and "turn-right" may be challening. Garmin may work on the clamp as it keeps on falling off. Otherwise the product is good buy considering there are options to save preferances (avoid highways, tolls, etc.)I bought these cause they were cheap yet looked cool . . . and cheap they were. Sound was pretty bad, in-line volume control worked well enough. However they stopped working several weeks after I bought them. The Sony Fontopia series sounds much much better but my last pair lasted only 6 months before the wire covers wore out and the wires eventually frayed. I have given up on cheap ear buds and have just purchased the Shure E2c's . . . hopefully they will last longer . . .It looks very nice and functionally not much different from any other oven. I think it is good value buy.I've owned this for several years.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes devices attached are recognized, sometimes they're not.  Also, not Linux compatible.Not impressed. Rarely used and only watched around 10 movies until the amplifier died. The sound was not great either. The subwoofer alone is cheap. Looked at it and laughed. The warranty on this is not good. Be advised. Find a good company with a good warranty. Stay away from this company.I received the Verbatim 100-Disc Spindle DVD in good conditions. However, the box was too damaged. Please, tell UPS that this material should be "Handled with Care" for future references. ThanksInstallation disk won't run.  I tried to install it on a 6 month old Toshiba MX35-S111 laptop with 5x the CPU, 10x the memory, and 30x the hard drive space required according to the box.  I made sure nothing else was running.  The installation failed repeatedly.  Delorme should test their product better before shipping.  After several hours of trying, I gave up and returned it.  I'll give one of their competitors a try.Garmin apparently has big problems with the Garmin 305.  I'm currently using my third unit.  The first two went defective within 10 days of purchasing. Be prepared for problems if you purchase a 305This is second honeywell tower I have bought.  First still serves me well but had to tape cover on after repeated cleanings that were frustrating in reassembly.  Otherwise does good job of cleaning air.I really can't review this cuz I bought it for my niece for XMAS. And she thanked me of course, but she never told me how good or bad it is.Have owned since 10/2006.  This was happening from the get-to.  When screen not frozen, this player is superb, however, when frozen, frustrating as there was no rhyme or reason or pattern.  When sent back to Creative, they claim the LCD is cracked and therefore will NOT honor warranty, extended or otherwise, due to so-called physical damage.  Told me they hoped I purchased shipping insurance and I might try filing a claim to recoup loss knowing full well shipper will not reimburse loss without proof of shipper damage and, Creative admits, the shipping was intact and had no damage.  They have no explanation to a cracked screen which left here with no known LCD problems.  I have since found massive complaints of spontaneous LCD problems that Creative apparently will not cover.  Very expensive lesson.  I will keep to disposable $30 models from now on - they last much longer!  Link to numerous complaints and possible class action suit. [...]We flew to Japan (12 hours) and the batteries lasted long enough to use them on the flight back as well. Worked very well.I bought this product not expecting much after people had complained about static noise while using it. Well it worked like an absolute dream for me! One of the best items I have ever bought!I bought these on the hope I would work much better even with my children yelling around. As many other customers, I don't give a sh..., errr, I don't care, about my computers or air conditioners humming (which are uniform and of low intensity), but I do care about people talking around me and making other disturbing noises. These headphones are ***decent*** (I expected them to be GREAT) at canceling uniform humming sounds, but DO NOT CANCEL (or even attenuate satisfactorily) human conversation/yelling frequencies. Bottom lines: - Moderately satisfied with spectrum profile, specially at low frequencies. - Very disappointed with noise canceling for "human noise".For a well known product, it was a great service and a good price.awsome  i've droped my shuffle and it's still in great shape. A great buy!!!!!!!!The unit I received would lock up. It would not reboot with the front panel power switch (even when pressed for over 5 secs), so I was constantly unplugging the system to get it restarted.The product was much cheaper than I could find elsewhere.  It does the job.Great product. I was able to salvage an old hard drive with minimal effort.This was easy to set up and has excellent sound for a table radio.This was easy to set up and has excellent sound for a table radio.Fast shipping. The cheapest price I could find even after the high shipping rate.This item is good to buy if any one already has the basic version.Good product, easy to install and set up, works great. Would like to see more selection on items it can readPerfect addition to the BOB stroller.  A must to help get back into shapeDont waste your money.  My 15 year old took very good care of hers, but within 2 months it stopped working.This scanner is great I dont know why people gave it bad reviews?... The Scan took long time but it gave what I want ^^ took longer then 10 days to reach my house ^^I bought this phone, but came open, without the manual information. By the way, works well and is a new product.I bought this shortly after buying my first generation shuffle and I loved it! It only just stopped working a few weeks ago, and given that I used it almost every day for nearly three years I think that's a pretty good run. I'm just sad that they don't seem to be making them any more.Dont waste your money.  My 15 year old took very good care of hers, but within 2 months it stopped working.Apple ipod is amazing.. can be used as back up storage as well. Great buy .. Super Saver shipping is slow..I had installation problems with this system.  Poor instructions, poor website, and poor service on the phone. I'm still waiting for a call back from their customer "service."I purchased this mouse for myself and loved it so much that I have purchased 4 more for people in my office.  It works great, is easy to use and stays charged forever!  Highly recommend.Good sound quality, even cheap batteries last a long time, easy to use, arm band included... over all a great buy.Started using it straight out of the box. Not too complicated to use and turn by turn voice directions are great.eforcity sent me a cheaper substitute item, so now I'm emailing trying to get what I ordered. This is the first item ordered from eforcity and last now.I purchased one for myself.  liked it so well I bought one for my wife.  Works great and a great price.Product DOA.  Installed on an old PowerMac G4.  Might as well have stuck a piece of toast in my machine.  Bought a card from Circuit City (~$20) which immediately worked fine.  Probably just got a bad card (quality control isn't the best on $4 electronics...).  Looking back, probably should have bought two at that cost hoping one of the two would be OK.Did not light up the area as well as I thought it would, although the batteries lasted longer than I expected.amazon attempted to charger twice for this item when it failed to deliver it.Good product, good service.  i didn't realize this was re-manufactured but maybe i just didn't fully read the ad.  It's good...Fantastic sound.  The in-ear ear plugs tend to come loose if you move around and have to be reset to get best sound quality otherwise absolutely amazing sound!I'm forever getting lost. The Garmin is really helping me find my way. The directions are dreadful, however. Luckily, I have sons-in-law who knew how to set it up. I need to figure out how to get it to find surface roads rather than main routes for those times I don't want to take highways, etc.We hardly used this DVD player & it lasted just long enough to pass the 6 month warranty -- then died.DONT BUY this  White Screen of Death device. Nokia refuses to admit design problems/Maybe the Mac version works better than the PC version, because this software is amazing under MAc OS X.  Highly recommended!Did not light up the area as well as I thought it would, although the batteries lasted longer than I expected.Nice product, well packaged for shipping.  Works great in the home, but not so good in the car, but I knew that before I bought it. Fast shipping.Nice product, well packaged for shipping.  Works great in the home, but not so good in the car, but I knew that before I bought it. Fast shipping.I was sent a external card reader instead of what I ordered. Maybe the picture and product information isn't the same.Headset,usb & Standard Stereo Behind was in very good condition, fast shipping, good quality.Easy to use, doesn't take up space like a regular high chair.  My daughter loves sitting at the table with us.Bought one. Didn't work. Called their tech support. After being put through typical basics (power cycle unit, try different cables, etc.) was instructed to return it for a new switch. Went through the same thing with second switch. This time I will get store credit and cut my losses.Two of the 3 fell to the counter within 1 week. Are still working and will use glue to restick. Not as much light as I expected. BPTwo of the 3 fell to the counter within 1 week. Are still working and will use glue to restick. Not as much light as I expected. BPEasy to setup and displays 1080i very well. Economy mode is plenty bright enough.Just like the others wrote, mine broke in about three weeks. They sound great, but the headset needs to be redesigned.I got my TV about a mounth ago   A+   Great TV easy to set up to work and great to watchThis software is very easy to use. It makes creating, editing and publishing RSS feeds very easy. I highly recommend it.This software is very easy to use. It makes creating, editing and publishing RSS feeds very easy. I highly recommend it.Easy to use, easy to clean and relatively quiet even on the high setting. It seems to work well and collects a good deal of dust, dirt, etc.  Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing how effective this air purifier really is.The unit stopped reading DVDs and started making a loud humming sound after only a few months. It is absolutely useless and there is no customer support whatsoever, even after repeatidly trying to contact them.I don't know how this happened, to be fair, but amazon shipped me this ink that's totally incompatible with the printer.I purchased this camcorder to replace an old Sony. After 1 DVD-R recording, I have decided to return it. The low-light performance was the killer. I used it to tape our child's first Christmas in normal, indoor lighting and it is very dark, almost unwatchable. The set-up was quite easy, but what good is easy set up if it takes poor videos? I am opting for the Sony 403 model.Ordered this with the black one, shipped on time and arrived as described and in good condition. Works fine with printer.I had a previous version of this and loved it.  When I saw this updated, newer and improved version I got it.  So pleased with it.  Great price and great product.  I highly recommend it!(1) Excellent picture (2) Sound is well above average for a 27" analog tvNOT MAC COMPATIBLE, NOT STILL ENOUGH, FREEZES UP, LOOK'S LIKE AN 1980'S SERVALENCE CAM.u can buy the game eq with 10 expansions for 17.00 right now on ebay this guy has to get realAt least mine turns on I guess.  Technical support for this item is a joke. Good luck if you buy one!I purchased this player recently from amazon.com. This is working good until now no probs.Wish sony had made a cordless remote instead of corded one...which makes u feel too many wires!! The velcro that is given to stick the unit is not great.. The cd player keeps falling!! This is a minor issue about the the product, we can use another thing to stick it.. On the whole good one!!!purchased this when native ports on my Dimension 9100 began to fail.  Thought i would try the $5 fix before buying a new desktop.  the USB card was delivered as promised and works as advertised.After owning a Hoover for a long time I went through a whole bunch of vacuums. First, an expensive Panasonic upright. The Panasonic was a disaster - it fit poorly together, destroyed a rug, but it sucked...it really did. Then a couple of cheap vacuums: a Eureka and something else. Not bad for the money. Each lasted about a year. Still junk though better than the Panasonic. Then, I bought this. Well made. Works well enough on carpets and wood floors. Good attachments. And easy to use and store.  Maybe, not the perfect vacuum but a bargain for $120 or so. Excellent value.Worked great for a month. Manufacturer replaced 1 month later. Ebay was no help at all.Dymo Labelwriter 400 is not combatable with Vista. No upgrade patch or driver.The microwave oven had a noisy, grinding sound when turned on. After seeing the high rating for the oven on this site and another, I thought it was a good buy but was very disappointed. I noticed another reviewer had a similar problem. I also found the door more difficult to open than others. Therefore I returned it and received a full refund.Use it for every shopping expedition--loaned it to a friend for their vacation. Easy to use, easy to read, easy to hear. Best buy in a long time!The card it's just good for the price really doesn't make a very very big difference with my old sound blaster 5.1, but it's cheap and works wellThe card it's just good for the price really doesn't make a very very big difference with my old sound blaster 5.1, but it's cheap and works wellI couldn't get my computer to even load this properly.  It said that Microsoft couldn't verify it was safe, the language was pidgin English, the instructions were obviously from someone who didn't know English well, and although I tried to contact the support Email and telephone message lines, I could never get anything but an automated "thank you highly and kindly for contacting us..."  Worthless!Great product - easy to use and works great, received timely. Thank you, GregI got less interference with the original itrip & it's range started at 87fm whereas this new one starts at 88.1fm.I was having a hard time deciding which karaoke player to buy, but liked the sound of a 5 disc changer. I read the reviews, many of which were negative, but decided to try it anyway with the hope that they were wrong.  When it came, it buzzed, clicked, and whirred just like another reviewer had said it would. No matter what I did, it would not play the discs I tried (regular or karaoke). Then, it wouldn't give me my cd back. After some effort (button pressing, shutting it down) it finally gave me back the disc.  Fortunately, I had ordered it from a store and was able to return it--otherwise I would have been stuck with shipping costs.We just returned from Alaska and the 1 GB xD picture card made takeing pictures easy due to the storage capability.Excellent Product, easy to use, not complicated.  Simply performs the job it is designed to do.  A great travel drive for data.Everything about the receiver is excellent.  The lettering on the front of the receiver is hard to read even from 15 ft.I've owned just about every model iTrip made going back to the Original iPod through to the Black model and even the iTrip (Dock connector model) & iTrip Auto. This one was far and away the best one. Too bad the newer iPod's lost the Remote plug on top.POSITIVES: -Slick design and looks good mounted on the wall. -Plays MP3 songs burned on a CD -Good sound & loud enough (not for parties) -It serves the purpose well -Good deal for the money NEGATIVES: -Some old MP3 CDs skip. All the new MP3 CDs I burned worked perfect though. -Clock turns off when the system is turned offThis enclosure is poorly made, drives don't fit well so they slide around, the connections are poor, the cables are too short, the top doesn't fit properly and has to be taped down, and before long, it won't even turn on. Pure garbage. I have to imagine that pretty much any other enclosure would be better but from now on, I'm sticking with externals for my back-ups.I bought five uniden headsets and, less than a year later, three consistently fail (i.e., disconnect, immediately run out of power though they've been charged for hours). I'm really disappointed with these phones and won't buy uniden again.I received my transmitter and it work great... exactly a week after using it, it stopped working completely. I keep trying but no luck. I cant send it back because its out of the package, my suggestion look further into the transmitter before buying to make sure it works longer than a week.My husband and I began using this GPS straight from the box; it was very user-friendly. The only problem we've encountered is that the ETA feature doesn't work correctly when the battery is low.Hei don't buy anything in here they never delivered my kids chrismas presents! very bad!!Spent an entire evening after installing trying different settings and all produced a picture on the monitor (and same printed on upscale printer from digital camera)that was clearly worse than what I started with so sent back.the player has stopped working. it freezes at the welcome screen and does not move ahead. it worked okay in the first 2 weeks . the following week , it used to stop at a song . restarting the player worked. a couple weeks later , the player froze at the welcome screen when started. when it was working fine , it worked okay . i have a 1 GB player 2 years ago of the same kind which still works fine. Maybe i just got a faulty piece this time aroundIf you want it to work correctly, INSTALL SOFTWARE FIRST, before you install the hardware.  Just go ahead and install the software before you even break-down your computer.  I wished I'd known this before I installed mine. I would have if I'd read the directions first.We bought this 3 months ago for our nano and haven't had any problems. Sound quality is great...absolutely no static ipod is always charged...works great on road trips.I made the mistake of buying a two-year subscription.  Every upgrade slows the product down.  A scan that used to take 14 minutes now takes over one hour. Stay away from this junk--there are much better free products available.The left side stopped working within 3 months. I did not think that the sound quality was all that better than the $30 sound isolating earphones I bought almost a year ago. Oh, and the $30 earphones STILL work.The left side stopped working within 3 months. I did not think that the sound quality was all that better than the $30 sound isolating earphones I bought almost a year ago. Oh, and the $30 earphones STILL work.I searched long and hard for this, read reviews and felt this would be the perfect gift for my 15 year old son for his birthday.I charged the battery and wrapped it up and it never worked. The door was closed but the player said it was open, therefore would not play the dvd.We sent it back. It's basic feel was cheap and plastic like. We don't know what the picture quality was like because it never worked.I bought this along with a camera, and it is really good. Basically I bought this one, because it had free shipping. To be honest found it kind of expensive. I bought it anyways, but it is pretty cool.Prompt delivery of product which is quite satisfactory. Tired of paying full price in local stores, so appreciate the price break!Creative was help and now I'm stuck with a cam that don't work.  I would never buy from creative again.Bulb life is terrible---bulb life is misrepresented by the sales people, bulb price are ridiculously high,!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i will never utter the word Toshiba again--.........Great wipers, and this is the second time I've purchased them for an Xterra and Subaru.  However, the shipping pack was poor and arrived damaged.  Fortunately, I was able to repair the bent 24 inch wiper.Hard to believe that Motorola would put their name on such garbage: Recurrent events fill up all days Daylight time arbitrarily syncs one hour early or late Alarm alerts change to thousands of minutes Some events simply skipped, others replicated endlessly Contacts shuffled numbers/types SLOW SLOW SLOW This is not sync software, it's just TRASH. Don't even THINK about wasting your time and money on this manure. Like a previous reviewer said, too bad there's no zero-star rating. Negative would be even better.It simply worked with a new Dell Vostro (no LPT ports) running Windows Vista and an old Canon BJC-1000 printer. Just connected, Vista recognized the printer and it was ready to go.Never sent in a box that product was supposed to come in -sent loose with only plastic covering and no paperwork-therefore I do not know how to set up or use product!After intall it, I could not find any difference. The signal with the Antenna was very similar to previous setting. But real signal was different and better than before. I like it.I find this product does the job.  I probably could go the cheaper route but I like that it works and lasts quite awhile.  I have found Amazon has the best price.After about a year, the right speaker stopped working. Wiggling the power switch would make it work briefly. Then a few days later it stopped working completely. I expect more for $300.I put a couple of these lights on the underside of my kitchen cabinets to add some additional task lighting. Unfortunately these lights simply are too dim to add any useable lighting.I put a couple of these lights on the underside of my kitchen cabinets to add some additional task lighting. Unfortunately these lights simply are too dim to add any useable lighting.Good high definition earphones, however value/price ratio is suffering... Problems: Sound is somewhat not very live; not enough bass - even for classical music. The "noisy" cord problem really kills the thing.Easy to put together. Bulky and somewhat flimsy. Bought it as a portable table to take on vacation with the kids. Would probably get something else, if I saw it before buying.we love the sounds 'n lights monitor.. it makes it so much easyer to keep a hear on my nephew from outside (mostly by the swimming pool) and we love that it plugs in and thats nice because we wont have to buy and replace as much!! over all its a great buy!!It smells like burning plastic when it runs. I thought that it would go away, but days later my whole house still stinks!Product worked well for 4 months, then suddenly failed to power on.  Product shows no sign of life whatsoever- extended service is through a 3rd party vendor, so I am guessing that repairs or service will be hard to acquire. Summarized: -product produced cleaner air than no filter at all, yet air quality seemed inferior to other true HEPA filters -clean air produced by filter had a consistent faint metallic smell -product was quiet, providing great white noise at night -oscillations were fluent and gentle -brief product lifespan severely limits quality- I simply cannot recommend this productGood unit - easy to use. The rear most USB input for charging it stopped working and my daughter who is not gently on electronics thought the whole unit was dead.  I soon discovered the unit had a second USB input for charging and didn't have to go through the whole repair hassle after warranty period expired.I have tried many solutions to work this webcam, and it still won't work with my laptop.  It is not compatible with computers (laptops and desktops) using the ATI graphics card.  After downloading the software, the USB device is still unrecognized.  Simply put, JUST BUY A DIFFERENT WEBCAM.I too had trouble with the tank leaking. My hands are small, making it very difficult to screw the top onto the tank tightly enough, so I learned to make sure it was on good, and made cappuccino successfully twice.  Well, this morning I made very sure it was on tight. Perhaps I put too much coffee in it??  I did not tamp it down, though.  Turned on the stove and waited.  All that happened was that the milk boiled - no coffee.  I finally poured the milk out and hoped the coffee would come up.  It never did.  Then I had a time removing the button mechanism - finally got it off, but I cannot get the tank top unscrewed!!  I may have to send it back with a note that the tank contains coffee and water!  Very disappointed!I have been using GoVideo VR 3845 for the last four months recoding to both DVD and VHS just great. Started using DV-In connection to my Sony Camcorder worked OK the first time. Second time "Not connected message". I call GoVideo service and they suggested replacing new used-once cable. The camera side indicated `DV connection', must be the GoVideo problem. Called again wait 10 minutes and hung-up on. Call third time again message "no customer support today" (Monday 1/9/2006). I wrote an email to customer support with NO RESPONSE (except the automated received notice). THANK YOU Costco for cash back return (keep your receipt and box it came in). For just this single reason alone of non-service, do not buy GoVideo products!There is no usb hub on the new dell mother board...make sure u check to see if u have the usb pins before u orderafter trying a generic brand of cartridge, trying to save money, sure enough, they wouldn't work; tight fit and never recognized by printer as being installed .... so went back to manufacturer named brand = no problems; too bad too because the cost savings on generic brands are sooooooo tempting.Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod nano 4GB for Free! I got mine from this web site:  http://snurl.com/ipodnano4I can not recommend this product, It is easy to connect and install, but impossible to get voice recording, support OK for I think AustraliaGot it today! Looks great! Plugged it in won't even light up! Now I have to pay the shipping back and wait!!!!!!!! What a bummer!!!!!!!!!!Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod nano 4GB for Free! I got mine from this web site:  http://dusturl.com/veBroke after 2 months of use. froze up. Called customer service. Was no help. poor quality. can hardly see screen. would never purchase sandisk again.It sounded like a nice product with all the features, but it does not work well. The time frequently changes to the wrong time and then back to the correct time later, sometimes this causes the alarm to malfunction. The phone is full of static. Great features - poor operation.The range and clarity was amazing when I got to hear them being used.  They are really loud and have a high quality of sound.Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod nano 4GB for Free! I got mine from this web site:  http://dusturl.com/veI purchased this for my wife's studio about 8 months ago; about 2 months ago the CD door started to stick and was difficult to close; now the CD player stopped recognizing CD's altogether; it is now just an AM/FM radio. Looks nice, but function came in second to form.Item became very hot.  Could only get connection when I was almost on top of the router.  It than failed completely all within 1 day.I bought a 42" Plasma, the sound stopped working the next day and sometimes the TV will not turn on. Very, Very Poor customer service.Flakey, like nearly all of D-Link's wireless products. Some days it works, connecting fine to the Dlink WPA-PSK router I have, and sometimes it won't connect at all. The 100mb/s wired ethernet always works, though, and works very well. A nice wired camera, that sometimes will do wireless as well.This really helped our baby sleep better. Made her feel safe and secure, so she slept longer. Can't say enough. This is a Must Have.They work very well, last quite a while and are easy to put on the games and cd's. A very good price for them too.Got what I wanted at the price I was willing to pay. Haven't used it yet because I haven't gone on a road trip yet.I purchased and installed this drive. It failed shortly afterwards. It made a whining noise and finally the OS failed to recognize it. I obtained an RMA and returned the drive to Maxtor. Nearly 3 weeks later, and they will not ship another drive because they have no replacement drives available. The drive ran great during the short period before it failed, but I cannot recommend it due to poor reliability and no product support.I have a pretty big house with a lot of walls in between the router and my computer. Sometimes my wireless signal will be really high, and sometimes really low. The performance however never seems to change. I would only recommend this to people living at home in smaller areas.I have had nothing but problems out of mine. first off, the screen went out due to a factory defect only 3 months after buying, got it fixed, and went out agian. I just took the piece of junk nad threw it away. I wouldnt waist my time with it.I bought this thinking it would be an adequate replacement for the original strap that came with the Polar F11.  Nope, not even close.  I tried wetting the strap hoping to get a reading.  NO LUCK.  Just should have bought the $55 strap and not wasted $21 on this one.This thing made a high pitched whining sound and clacking sounds. It would skip within a track. Very annoying. Don't bother with this piece of junk.I loved the 350 so much I got another one for my daughter. She used it to go on spring break and she said it worked great for her and her friends.Am sure this is a good product - just NOT for a Mac with and operating system of OS 9.2.  What was sent (2 times) was for current operating systems. Should not have advertised that it worked for older operating systems. Very disappointed.I bought a sharp lcd tv from j& r in new york last Jan, after a year and half, when powering on the tv, sometimes works, sometimes not. after unplug in, wait for a while and plug back, worked for a couple months. Send it to service center to checkup, was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced. when request to get back the replaced lcd control board, was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board, it has to be shipped back, otherwise, you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced board.. it's rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any vendor.. But, if you do want to get a sharp, better get a long long warranty..I bought a sharp lcd tv from j& r in new york last Jan, after a year and half, when powering on the tv, sometimes works, sometimes not. after unplug in, wait for a while and plug back, worked for a couple months.

It loaded okay and seemed to be working.  However, my computer was slowing down over time.  Two days ago, it basically came to a halt, showing 100% cpu usage with windows explorer.  I was finally able to uninstall Norton and everything is fine now (no thanks to Norton's customer no-service)!The software installed easily enough as I would expect, but subsequence problems are not handled well.  I tried numerous times using their web based help, even tried the "live" online technician (who as of 3 weeks ago, has yet to respond to my question... he may no longer be alive??), and still no ability to update new virus protection, which renders mine fairly useless.  I would say to buy a more reliable brand like Norton.This hub is great because you get USB 2.0 speed for all the attached devices. The cord on it is REALLY short, however, so I don't really recommend it for desktop computers. It's really for laptops.This is a good product, but it was shipped about a week late, and I was really disappointed.The sound quality is pretty thin and tinny on these, but not bad for the price, I guess.Thanks for the good service we received on this item.  It arrived in good shape and as expected.These cartridges are easy to replace in the printer and give good print quality--I just wish they lasted longer!  Amazon vendor has the best price I have been able to find for Canon branded replacement cartridges.Very fast service. Item is poorly made and broke 2 weeks after I started using it. Real junk.Bought this for my husband, he loves it; it works great, looks great, nice small size, highly recommend!Bought a Garmin 2720 refurbished unit and it is nothing but junk.  Stay away from purchasing anything refurb.I never received it.  The company had run out of this product and I ordered a different one.i bought this 18 months ago.  i purchased a refurb unit well about 2 months ago the ps started to act up. $90.00 later it's working again.  Many people have experienced this problem with the psOutputs are a bit limited; no HDMI IN to HDMI Out but otherwise works great and excellent valueBought this for my husband, he loves it; it works great, looks great, nice small size, highly recommend!Great to carry your camera and to keep it new, the case is easy to carry, great product.first one wasbroken after one month, and amozoon replace it for free, now its working very good, thanksI've own one of these before and went back to buying another one. GREAT PRODUCT and very user-friendly.I purchased two of these enclosures thinking that a manufacturer can't possibly screw up a metal box and a power supply. Apparently I was wrong! Less than 24 hours after installing my hard drive into the enclosure, I heard a popping sound and then smelled melting plastic. The power supply was completely fried, and I have a dead hard drive to top it off. I tried the second enclosure as well and started smelling burnt plastic immediately after plugging it in. I would strongly caution you against purchasing this enclosure.This is a comfortably fitting headset with great sound. The mic rotates to the best position for speaking.This is the first air purifier my husband and I have purchased and we love it. Great Product.For my ancient hard drives, this item is useless - wrong # of pins - not worth returning.This is the best case I've ever used or worked on.  I've now have 2.  I have used the first one for 3 years. Excellent access all around.  Hard drives are easy to get at.  Motherboard tray makes installation a snap.  It is well made, functional and attractive. It is on the pricey side, but well worth it. Everytime I work with a different case, I realize how great this one is.This is a good product if you like your tires to look new but not too shiney. It could last longer and attract less dirt though. Amazon shipped it pretty quickly considering it was for free.Good pricing, like the no shipping and handling charge and no tax!  Product received in promised time frame.I have never used anything but Norton, but read the raving reviews about System Mechanics and bought it.  It seems to do a lot of things, but nothing really well.  It also finally ruined a harddrive installation, so I went and got a new bootable harddrive.  After installing everything, incl my old Windows 2000 and all my other software, having everything set up, I finally installed System Mechanics 6 Pro,- and ruined everything.  It supposedly fixed 243 errors.  However, NOW I can barely boot the computer, I am unable to install or upgrade anything and the system is as unstable as I have never seen it before.  in short everything is ruined and I have to start again from scratch with formatting my harddrive. Thanks guys.Had to send it back to Amazon. Amazon refused to pay the 7 dollars UPS shipment cost. Told me cause it was initially sent via "free shipping", can't reimburse shipping costs.I rate this a 'no-stars' transactionI checked my status page and it said that my order was delivered, but I never received it!!!The review below was written about a version of Spy Sweeper that was released several years ago. The program has been updated and the latest version is working quite well.  (I can't speak about support because I haven't had to call in a long time.)  If asked now, I would give it a rating of 4 stars. =======  the following was written with my original purchase in 2004 I read all the reviews that talked about non-existent support and paid attention to one co-worker who said Spy Sweeper worked pretty well.  I bought it.  I ran into problems.  The reviews were apparently right.  If you need help you're not going to get it  from Webroot software.  I should have stuck to Ad-Aware and HiJack This! Oh well, live and learn I guess.  Here's hoping you don't make the same mistake.I have 65 lbs in this bag and it isnt bending or sagging a bit. Im going to get another 1This product stopped initializing after using it twice. The logo comes on and that is it. I have tried everything I have found on the internet and the sansa website. It is a well known problem without an answer. DON'T BUY THIS!Too many problems: 1. Poor picture quality and faint, hissy sound at startup. Have to run Autoscan several times to correct, each and every time it's turned on. 2. Skips numerous known channels. No way to override and bring them in. 3. When picture quality finally corrects, sound and pic aren't synched (a few seconds delay) 4. Remote sometimes works, sometimes doesn't 5. Gets "stuck" on channel 2. Won't advance to next up, but will go back. 6. Apparent poor customer service: Sent email to vendor, got auto ackn of my email, but nothing further. Too many hassles. Back it goes for a refund.Have older Griffin Itrip until it broke.  Convinced this was best option.  Constant static in and out of city made this product unlistenable (is that a word?).  I would avoid at all costs.  I returned and will go with Griffin Road trip.This version is much better than the older Norton AV program I replaced.  I can now use the outgoing email scanning setting. The old program would hang while scanning outgoing email and cause excessive CPU usage until I used the Task Manager to kill it. Norton AV 2006 also appears to use less CPU resources while scanning than the old version. I'm happy with it.After my last review, I found a package by my doorstep. It was a replacement LED night light, to replace the one that had failed in my previous order. Completely out of the blue! Really, at the price, I considered this to be basically a throw-away item. But Maxxima still sent me a replacement. That was just awesome. Next time I'm looking for any kind of light, I'm going to see what Maxxima has first.works great, easy to use but wish it held under the mattress a bit better.first one I had went through the washer and dryer 3 times before failing. And I really like the design.  the the capped usb drive I was always losing the cap, which meant the connector ended up getting damaged and thus unusable.  These little suckers are great!I have used the data traveler once since I got it. I feel it is quite slow in downloading  and uploading the data.when i needed to correct my downloaded information it took just as long to get it downloaded.  It serves my purpose but is quite slow.This is a functional, attractive boombox. I bought it for a kid, and it's fine for that. If you want clarity or good bass, keep looking. If you're just looking for a radio and something that plays cds w/o great sound quality, this is a good deal.Very disappointed that this thing only lasted a month. Go with the cheapo brand and save some money.I low the functionality of these drives.  They work great and are always recognized by the systems I use them on.  I really wanted to rate this higher but cant get past the horrible design flaw that the caps never stay on long.  I went thru the 3 caps it came with in about a month.  They come off way too easy - lost them all.We love this product, however, it isn't even 6 months old yet and the battery is dead.  Unlike the directions, we never recieved a low battery warning.  We are planning on replacing it with a different brand...love the concept but have had problems with Infant Summer products.I received great service, as usual, drive arrived 5 days prior to expected delivery date. Worked just like advertised right out of the box. Has ability to run from firewire or USB which was the selling point for me. It kept USB ports open for other devices.I had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds. The sound quality was good, but the dependability of this item is questionable.This was an OK product.  However, the face tracking did not work as well the other cameras I tested.Battey is great. Holds a charge longer that the OEM Dell. For less that half the $199 Dell price.Bought for my wife but I use it more.  Still haven't read the whole manual because it's so easy to use.  I may let my wife use it some.I'm a software tech., and regularly run "several" anti-spyware programs. The older versions of SpySweeper, caused problems...! I really like the newer 4.5 version (read my review on tips...).I bought this item through Amazon and after my second time using it, a white screen came on and it just stopped working. After trying everything possible to get it to work, I returned and received a new one from Amazon. After I used this new one for the first time, the SAME THING HAPPENED! I'm not sure what is wrong with this product, but it looks like Amazon recieved a bad batch of product. I would suggest waiting for it to come on sale at Best Buy or Circuit City instead of buying it from here. At least there you don't have to wait a long time to return something and get your money back.For the price, this is an excellent deal.  Great sound, ok battery life, very easy to use and the software works well with Windows Vista and XP.  Highly recommended.Taking phote is good outdoor, but poor indoor. Somewhat worse than average 5MB compact camera. Video is ok both outdoor and indoor. Clearly worse than average Mini DV camcorder.After one successful printing it didn't work at all. My printer is HP deskjet 712C. This cable seemed to be recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected.After following all directions on this product, there was still static even on the clearest channel.  Could not get clean reception.  Big disappointment and would not recommend to anyone.served its purpose (for workouts and whatnot)....nothing bad to say about it...it would get 5 stars if it somehow was designed to cover the top half of the i-podNeeds no drivers (on XP). Needs no additional sync software. Connects directly to USB, and gets recognized as a regular USB drive. Just copy/paste songs using Explorer. Works great.served its purpose (for workouts and whatnot)....nothing bad to say about it...it would get 5 stars if it somehow was designed to cover the top half of the i-podserved its purpose (for workouts and whatnot)....nothing bad to say about it...it would get 5 stars if it somehow was designed to cover the top half of the i-podserved its purpose (for workouts and whatnot)....nothing bad to say about it...it would get 5 stars if it somehow was designed to cover the top half of the i-podI have a new black BMW and this product was a snap to apply and had my car looking HOT! I am going to recommend to all my friends!This is my 2nd time at purchasing the SanDisk Sansa M240 and for the second time now it has stopped working within a week.  Freezing at the first screen.Item received as described. Gave item as a shower gift so I'm not sure how well it works. I'm sure it will be used by the new parents. Thanks!I didn't realize this item would be as well made as it is. Great paint job too! My 9 yr. old daughter loves it... Good Christmas gift stocking stuffer.Easy to install.  Easy to read instructions.  It is great being able to watch your cable/digital TV anywhere, anytime....At home or away from home.  I highly recommend this product!I have two Volkswagen with in-window antennas in the rear windows. Obviously the iTrip is too weak to get the signal through the car! Even it it works in the standing car, as soon as I started driving the signal got disturbed pretty fast. Currently for me a lost investment, perhaps I try on of the bigger ones but unfortunately it is complicated to get info about signal strength.Ordered BRAND NEW Garmin GPS from Amazon.  Received used and non-functional GPS.  Returned it and received ANOTHER used and non-functioning  GPS.  Returned that and then had to wait weeks for a refund. Amazon the problem!!!  Never to use Amazon again!!!!Before you install new ink cartridges, let the old ones completely run out, let the software indicator turn red.  Otherwise Canon's software will not recognize that the tanks have been replaced and will continue to indicate your out of ink.Good unit bought before cheap tuners were available. Does everything well except occasional freezup when changing channels. Only way to fix this is to unplug the unit for about ten seconds to reset it. See related review of Insignia tuners.The sound was fine on this device but I gave it one star because it would not sit up properly and would lean backwards until it was completely flat. I ended up returning it to Amazon and not purchasing another.I purchased this CPU to replace a faulty one in a Dell Computer, I ended up rebuilding the entire system. This CPU is an excellent unit, perfect for a gaming system it is a very good buy for the price.I'll keep this short as there are so many reviews of this product. I have owned these headphones for a few years now and during this time I have watched them slowly fall apart. While the sound quality and noise canceling ability is still excellent, the materials used in construction are clearly sub-par. - the ear pad covers are flaking off - both arms connecting the ear cups to the head piece are cracked and held together with tape I expected much better from Bose. Keep looking.I got this MP3 player for my son for a gift.  It worked for 30 days and completely stopped working.  I can not find a reset button and technical support at Sandisk is non-existent.  (I did get the white one, however, not the blue one)  I ended up buying him the Insignia which has been working much better and has much better sound.  What a disappointment.  I gave it 2 stars instead of one because I got my daughter the same one which is still working, but the sound is awfulBought one about 2 years ago for myself. Worked great. No problems. Liked it so much I bought one for my son-in-law who just got a new ipod. Works well with 30 gB ipod, Nano, and 30 gB photo. Nice quality sound, no static, good volume. Easy to pick a frequency.I eagerly awaited the delivery of this software so that I could begin creating a new landscape for my home, only problem is once I received it and started using it became quite evident that this program does work as advertised. Three times after spending hours creating my house and starting a landscape plan the program crashed and did not save my work even though I had frequently hit the "saved" icon. Needless to say this program is being reboxed and sent back. Save yourself a headache and buy a different landscape software program. Cheap ain't, you get what you pay for!Sweat gets into it easily during exercising and eventually malfunctions even after drying up. Otherwise plays well, sleek look, great size.I shouldn't have purchased headphones based on sexy packaging-I thought I was too smart for that!! But, I'm not. And so I guess I deserve these crappy headphones. I won't bother rehashing what everyone else has said, I'll just confirm these facts: the sound sucks the quality is garbage (they began falling apart literally days after purchase) and the fit is uncomfortable at best and dangerous at worst (who wants a perforated tympanic membrane??) Buyer bewareGot the camera, for best price I could find from reputable business. Camera arrived with a cracked sensor, emailed Amazon and another was on the way the next day !! Great service. Thanks Amazon for taking care of your customers.I made the mistake of ordering this product without reading any of the reviews... no words can even come close to describing the amount of frustration you would feel trying to use this software... as for me, I could not even get passed getting the activation code... I tried to get support but I am begining to seriously think that they don't even exist or even if they are a legitamate company... beware...This program was not what I expected.. I got a better aquarium from the internet on a free download. The selection of fish is very poor. Settings were nice and lighting was good.I bought this product based on the great reviews I read.  Unfortunatley, I have not had as much luck as everyone else.  This is the second FM transmitter I've purchased for my iPod (the first actually sounded great, but did not fit properly in my car)and was really hoping for much better sound quality.  There's a lot of static and a high pitch squell, not all the time, but most of the time.This dvd player failed to recognize all copied dvds I made.  The box clearly states that this dvd player will play DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW.   Well, I tried both -R and -RW types.  Bad disc message is all that I received. No recognition of anything I had recorded. So, I went and put both DVDs into my panasonic dvd player and they played great. I would say stay away from this dvd player.The unit I received from Amazon quit working just before the 30 day return period.  I left on vacation just after it arrived and didn't really start to use it until I got back.  I ultimately ended up getting a new unit direct from Garmin. My main reason in noting this is that the first unit arrived obviously having been opened previously (light dust on the rubberized grip; user manual creased, etc.)  While I understand that people return products and vendors need to try and resell them, I wish they would identify them as such.  I suspect this unit got returned because it was acting erratic, but it was missed or ignored by Amazon.  Basically I think the Garmin GPS unit is fine; I'm just annoyed with Amazon.WARNING: AVOID THIS PRODUCT! This program bites badly! It totally crashed my XP system and the few times it briefly ran it looked like I was running some ancient DOS-based program in emulation mode. This software is a ripp-off. Broderbund comes out with new versions so you will think they've update this ancient relic but all they've done is add some fluff and left the underlying old bug-riddled incompatible piece of trash intact.Incredibly light, detachable cords, and amazing sound. Oh, did I mention AMAZING ambient isolation? And still under 65 bucks? Go get itI bought a sharp lcd tv from j& r in new york last Jan, after a year and half, when powering on the tv, sometimes works, sometimes not. after unplug in, wait for a while and plug back, worked for a couple months. Send it to service center to checkup, was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced. when request to get back the replaced lcd control board, was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board, it has to be shipped back, otherwise, you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced board.. it's rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any vendor.. But, if you do want to get a sharp, better get a long long warranty, it would help down the road.I bought a sharp lcd tv from j& r in new york last Jan, after a year and half, when powering on the tv, sometimes works, sometimes not. after unplug in, wait for a while and plug back, worked for a couple months.

I never used a map or made a wrong turn.  Very easy to use.drains batteries like no tomorrow. Doesnt even last the night. Used it once and never bothered again had to buy another fan.This switch works great!  It's easy to install and has no loss of video signal at all.  The order was just as easy and arrived in less time than the shipping method indicated.Ist good and have good functions but it needs much batteryIT'S A GOOD PRODUCT, SOMETIMES IS HARD TO USE THE PROGRAM.Alarm sometimes does not work. Still trying to figure out why.Worked well from first installation.  Little monitor is amazing.  Had to replace at end of year but bought another just like it.Very good product.  Does just what it promised.  Good delivery time.Fits My iPod Perfectly. Full Protection. Best Case Ever. Great Quality.We love these! They sound really good when attached to the computer and awesome when attached to an mp3 player. Good buy!I bought this for my husband, and it is working great.I bought these based on excellent reviews, but no amount of fiddling is getting any bass from these headphones.  I'm very dissapointed.Works great, easy to use, excellent clearity, good volume control. Just like listening to the car radio.  GREAT buy for the cost.I bought this product not realizing that it did not have a touch screen. It seemed to have been an older model, as all the new models have touch screen. Works great otherwise.I never received my purchase, i have sent numerous emails to amazon and to the other vendor, but no body ever responded.if the battery is brand new it works great.  as soon as the battery is half used it starts shutting off frequently.Worked fine @ the start. Less than a year now and it skips, jumps, stalls and sleeps even with new batteries. Looks great though. The software seems to corrupt itself every couple of months and never did get all the functions...Good Luck. If you want a good looking coaster get the MX1000 green, NICE...Steve AGreat product.  I have used this more than I had expected.I bought this machine a few months ago - used it twice and never again... Made a huge mess on my stovetop and was extremely hard to clean... Nice to look at though...These pens are really nice to write with.  They do not leak and the ink line is clean and tight.  Great product.Pretty good right out of the box.  Excellent when flashed with the latest version of DD-WRT!!! Tons of features will be added.Warning to people who want to use this device for cassettes: It ate the very first one I tried to play. Other problems: Poor radio reception and uneven volume when playing audio CDs.The item was shipped promptly, although the clip art was terrible.The item was shipped promptly, although the clip art was terrible.The first week, I have put this phone to the test! And, it still works great! Great product for a reasonable price!Usual quality from Norton as expected, but this new version slows down my computer.  It runs too much in the background...that seems to slow down both (fairly new) computers I put it on.This product is very pretty but does not fit the Graco Safe Seat as it is too narrow and short for it.The highest volume setting is barely audible. The options are limited. More profit for an American company at the expense of Americans.I basically took thsi phone due to its speakerphone feature and the price. I never got disappointed...the speaker is loud and clear and the mic has never given me a problem too. Awesome!I'm just an average user; doing some photoshop, web browsing, etc, and this tool really makes the image much better to my eyes.  I've used it on an iBook(G4), Mini(G4), eMac(G4), an old and new iMac(Intel), with Tiger and Leopard, and in each case it makes the image much better, and certainly better than anything I could do manually myself fiddling around with the controls.  Highly recommended even if you only use it once in a while.  It really does make the image much better to my eyes.At first I could burn DVDs OK.  Then I started losing one in 5 (freeze on recording file, on finalization, etc.).  Then 1 in 3.  then it stopped recognizing DVDs altogether -- blank DVDs, recorded DVDs, commercial DVDs, whatever.  Only CD and VCR functions still work.  Since I bought it to transfer VHS to DVD, it's useless to me.  GoVideo Customer Service strung me along just long enough for the warranty to expire.  BAD PRODUCT; BAD COMPANY.Tried them out, switched the buds a few times, very unhappy with the fit and comfort level. Immediate regret followed by return.Very poor light sensitivity means all you get is a mostly black picture except it bright daylight.  Only supports proprietary Microsoft formats and cannot be integrated into a web site.  Even when there is enough light, image quality is poor.  Don't waste your money.Bought mount of a 20" flat screen TV. Very imprested with the quality and appearance.Easy to install and ajustments are endless A+++At first couldn't create a playlist using WMP 10. Downloaded WMP 11 (beta) and haven't had any problem creating playlists.  Everything working fine. Might have to upgrade to the M260 for more space.This plug-in USB gang hub has saved me from crawling around a tight spot behind my CPU to plug and unplug devices.Norton Internet Security 2006 [Old Version - The Amazon reviews for this product listed that it considerably slowed down their computer operating systems.  They were right.  I would not recommend buying this version.I'm only giving this 3 stars because MS made this so bloated it's ridiculous!  It works, it just has too much fluff!It is a great little lens, yet it didn't fit the Cannon SD20, yet if you manually hold it in place it works just fine. Great for opening up shots and getting landscapes.I really like this product, it helps me get more organized and I have started using it to store music. It's awesome.BE WARE.   This product was designed specifically for use with TINY mp3 players like the ipod shuffle (which is, in my opinion, another ridiculous product) and is not much use for anything else.  The cord is hardly a foot long.  I had to return it immediately.Excellent plasma. Highly recommended. I did research for 1 month and finally decided to buy this unit. Amazing picture and sound quality. The only down side is that inputs are vertical so it makes hooking up components a bit difficult.Living in a country where stations don't need much power to get good coverage, I figured this might be a good buy. I was wrong, way wrong. Even the weakest of stations step over the transmitter's signal like it wasn't there. I had to resort to tuning slightly off frequency so the FM stations would be tuned out.. and even then performance was only marginal. I'm taking this thing back to the store tomorrow. Not worth it.I burn lots of DVD's with my laptop, using an external burner. These Verbatim discs are excellent for any purpose, whether it be archiving your mp3 collection, making backup copies of your movies, making your own movies, etc. Great discs at a great price!I read the bad reviews but I bought it, it worked for one week and died. Pure Junk, avaoid anything by Griffin.So yea, im STILL waiting to recieve my monitors, i ordered them on feb 21st and they're still not here. im pretty pissed. i guess i can't comment on how they work so good luck.So yea, im STILL waiting to recieve my monitors, i ordered them on feb 21st and they're still not here. im pretty pissed. i guess i can't comment on how they work so good luck.Fountain pens are so expensive, and I find I love the fact that these are easy accessible, disposable, well made pens. They have a good ink flow and feel good in the hand.This webcam just won't work with Vista.  I have searched high and low for a driver for this, but none of them do the trick.  And to think I just bought this!  The Logitech I bought several years ago has Vista drivers and works great, and Creative doesn't even bother updating the drivers for such a recent product. Should've known not to trust the short sighted Singaporeans. Swiss rocks! Avoid this if you plan on running Vista.Well...I took a chance and got something based on the low price.  I knew that it was kinda risky not to follow my instincts.  After only a few uses, it broke.  Oh well...I just took it as a lesson and moved onto Sony.Very funny.  My whole family roared with laughter.  Very well done.used kaspersky products for many years. very reliable, great virus protection, always timely updates and helpful customer service. would recommend to everyone.Nothing but the alarm clock part even worked. The CD player never worked and the phone was constantly changing channels making horrible sounds from static to ear piercing squeaks. The concept was great, but the quality was so poor I'm not even risking an exchange to see if it was a lemon.My 7 and 9 year old boys could benefit from learning touch typing.   I bought this program and they used it over Christmas vacation, but then never went back.   I also bought SpongeBob typing and found it was more engaging.   They still don't know how to touch type, but at least this is a first step.Tried upgrading from 2005 to 2006, but the activation screen would always freeze before the program could connect to verify. Problem appears to happen quite often when I searched around, but other than making sure all appropriate services and programs were running (and they were) there was no solution. Updating via LIveupdate did not help. EVEN WORSE... when I went back to 2005 the same thing happened, so now both Norton AV 2005 and Norton AV 2006 are useless. Support has been no help. This is a product to stay away from!If you are considering purchasing this with CD burning as your primary concern, Save Your Money! 7.5 is a cataclysmic disappointment. An actual downgrade from Version 6. I should have left well enough alone.MY FIRST MP3 PLAYER. I FOUND IT EASY TO USE, IT HAS EXCELLENT SOUND & MANY USEFUL FEATURES.  FM RADIO WORKS GREAT HERE IN NYC. BATTERY LASTS AS LONG AS THEY CLAIM- ABOUT 15-18 HOURS. EARPHONE BUDS SOMETIMES POP OUT OF MY EARS, BUT OTHERWISE ARE FINE.i purchased a white Sony Bean about two years ago and have had great fun with it.....now i regret my decision to buy it. The flismy USB cover snapped off awhile ago,i can no longer adjust the volume,the headphones stopped working months ago and the latest development?I can no longer charge it because the USB jack has broken.....My advice?Save your money and buy a video IPOD or something more durableI purchased this item from Amazon.  When I received the item it was covered with dust, was probably sitting in a warehouse forever.  When opening the item the contents were well past the expriation.  The cleaning gel sent was completly dried up and looked as if it had dried up a long time ago.  The product I received from Amazon was completly useless.  They have some very poor inventory management.I was using this iPod adapter for a few days when suddenly my car started to behave extremely strangely -- the clock stopped working, the central locking system failed, the door alarm went off all the time (even when the door was closed), and the RADIO STOPPED PLAYING ALTOGETHER! When I took it to an electrical auto specialist, he checked my fuses and found that the 3-in-1 had actually FRIED my fuse. He swapped the fuse out, told me never to use that piece of junk again, and everything worked properly. This no-name product is total garbage and for that matter dangerous. Use at your own risk if you are foolish enough to buy.While it looked good and played good for the first day, this SanDisk Sansa M420 stopped working the second day.  Efforts to remedy the situation with SanDisk were a waste of time - even they suggested returning it to Amazon.  Amazon responded with a credit instead of a new player.  We purchased a Creative Zen player as a replacement.I installed this software about two weeks ago, and it screwed up my email, it screwed up Word and it interfered with my firewall. I have spent many hours talking to Symantec tech support - actually I have spent many hours on "hold" and a couple of minutes getting useless advice. I am currently trying to negotiate a refund.Purchased these adapters (bought two) in the hope that my remote computer wireless connections would drop off less frequently but have been somewhat disappointed in that the performance, while good, is still not much better than with the older technology.  This adapter works well but not quite up to the five star level.  Still recommended....good bang for the buck.This thing is a joke. It doesn't play loud enough except for low volume listening. There is no handle to make moving it easy. Cheap, flimsy construction and a door that you know is going to break soon, no battery back-up for the memory. I would rather pay more and get something better. I am going to return it.easy to use , smart design and works well without issues.I always wanted to purchase the Bose QC2 headphones but the price always deterred me.  The Panasonic headphones perform just as well as the higher priced Bose.  Good buy for anyone looking for quality noise canceling headphones for less thand $200.Took it out of the box and started using it right away. It is so easy to use. I am a "gadget guy" and sometimes things are so difficult to understand when you open the box. Forget about it! This is one of the easiest things I have ever used. Great on trips. It even recalculates when you go off course on a street that you know. Nice picture screen. No reading glasses required. You will not be disappointed. Downloads very easy too.    Buy it!We were really excited to finally switch from DVR to Tivo, but when our tivo came and we plugged it in, the video quality was awful.  Way way worse than the TV ever was.  We tried everything, got new cables, called tivo, did the software update.  Nothing made it any better.  It was so obviously worse than our cable ever looked, we had to return it :(  We decided it wasn't worth the effort to try to get a new one.  So back to DVR!There are many issues with this tablet. It was my first tablet and I now currently use a Bamboo Fun Wacom, which, even though it's smaller, is much highed in quality and never screws up. However, when I was using the adesso, the pen constantly didn't work, and I don't recall the pen pressure ever working. Many times I had to re-install and un-install the software to even use it, and half the time that didn't even work. One of my friends recently purchased this product and the tablet has not worked yet. I highly recommend not buying from Adesso, and go for the smaller Wacom tablets instead. This tablet annoyed me constantly and was very unreliable.This upgrade installed easily with my Photoshop 5.5.  No problems at all.  This is an excellent program and leap years ahead of my Photoshop 5.5.  This is a much less expensive way to upgrade to cs2..rather than purchasing CS2 outright. Be sure to get the updates after you install the program.never more will I get lost again. Just as good as what we used to fly with. highly recommend. no need to look for where you are going, just drive and let it tell you. much safer.we purchased the vacuum based on previous reviews found online from other people who also purchased it. I think it's a really good quality product, bagless and light weight. Attachments are perfect for our new wood floors.Cost, good. Quality of picture, soso. I was not able to establish a web link to the camera. Motion detection works real good. Better than standard web cam but picture quality is poor. Wireless feature is good.This keyboard is awful. The cheap-feeling keys stick all the time, the "right-click" portion of the touch pad is poorly positioned for right-handed people so that every time you try to move the cursor right-click menus appear.New cartridge had been received on time and well packed. Printouts are in good quality. 1 Concern: overpriced. I must add another concern: not much ink in it. Cratridge is emptied after 2 months of light usage.I purchased this after having another Sharp that was bigger, but lasted many years. To make this one so inexpensive, Sharp has really gone down hill in my mind. The dim touch pad is poorly designed and certainly NOT much of an engineering marvel. Just how hard would it be to make the most used touch buttons to stand out? (Like START or STOP being bigger than the numbered buttons on this touch pad?) C'mon Sharp--you can do much better!This rig certainly works fine in ideal conditions, that is to say with the right wall, the right stud in the right spot. Otherwise, as good as it is, it goes straight in the attic under "useless stuff". No need to say that, even if I could install it, the cabling would still be a nasty snake nest crawling up the wall.When I received this DVD player and connected it, there was a loud buzz coming from the audio. The video was fine and there was an audio track, but with a loud buzz  (even with no DVD disc loaded). I tried two different TV's, different cords, different connections, and still the loud buzz. I contacted a Sony technician online and tried to troubleshoot the problem. He said the unit was defective. It seems that Sony's QA (quality assurance) needs improvement.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007P6NX6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title This product has actually worked really well. I use them for content that HSN uses for on air and they have worked well so far.Some genius decided to affix a paper ad to the front of this machine with permanent glue that cannot be removed without an hour of scrapping, leaving a scratched and marred front. It's too bad that Royal let such a stupid problem infect what I am willing to assume is a well designed machine. By the way, calling the Royal consumer service line gets you to a completely useless person in India.I purchased this device primarily because I wanted an FM receiver.  I liked the compact size, capacity, battery (charge and recharging) but I intended to wear it while running.  First, the manual stinks and I couldn't figure out how to turn it off, or stop the repeats.  Eventually I worked that out.  The ear buds caused sores in my ear canals and constantly fell out.  I replaced these with SONY $80 ear buds that aren't much better.  Then I couldn't see the display when I ventured outdoors.  The quality of the display just kept getting worse, until it died completely.  Finally, the whole thing stopped playing after 27 days.  I took it back to SONY and the manager told me that it had been abused.  He would send it back to SONY for an autopsy and let me know whether it was covered by the warranty.  I simply used it while running.  I haven't received the forensic report yet but I wouldn't recommend this product.This product is very nice and smart, runs good. Very easy to use. Recalculate fast. But, sometimes, when start up, it costs a long time to acquire signal . That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.Yes to what everyone else has said.  Problems installing, some features don't work for no discernable reason, reasource hog, long startup time, etc.  I bought this and Ghost 10 and I consider that completely wasted money.  I'd strongly recommend going with another company for software of this type.I bought this used for about $30 instead of paying $3/mo to comcast. Worked great after some struggle. There was a little problem with comcast giving me internet connection when I replaced the modem. But I first connected the PC to the modem (instead of through a wireless router that I had placed in between before). Rebooted things Modem followed by PC) and everything worked fine.I bought this product back in December '07 and have yet to get it to work properly.  The player is very slow and loses signal, or has to re-buffer constantly.  It can't even get through an entire song without stopping a couple of times, then it just freezes and requires a restart.  I've installed the newest firmware, but that hasn't fixed anything.  Customer support assumes that I'm an idiot and that it's my fault that the media player isn't working right.  It'll sometimes let me stream Rhapsody music through it, but then decides to stop working.  The USB port works only periodically as well.  Wish I would have taken this back a long time ago.cannot get this thing to work at all.  the instructions are useless.  am I missing something here?  I'm echoing the previous reviewer.  I'm not unfamiliar with computers and build my own.  the website equally useless, I'm afraid.  rma, uninstall, there. Interesting, I had tried to plug this into a powered hub which shared several devices, including a Belkin UPS.  Plugged this in and immediately the ups shut off the power.  Upon restarting, now the PC cannot recognize the ups(but all my other usb stuff OK)....uninstall, reinstall, keep getting the dreaded "unrecognized device" for the ups-usb, which evidently means in my case that the ups' usb interface is fried, evidently.  I had tried to use this before and two different mobos showed stange behaviour with the usb interface ultimately requiring board replacement, and now I'm beginning to think that maybe it was this device, as before I had plugged it into the case front usb, which plugs directly into the motherboard and near the south bridge.I've owned these headsets for just over a month now.  The padding on the ear cuffs keeps coming off and it is impossible to put it back on properly.  I mostly just rely on the headset pressure (which is not bad) to hold them in place while wearing.  The active noise cancellation does indeed work, but it really is no big deal (on this headset or any other).  I never really even bother to turn it on anymore.  Then general sound quality seems fair enough.Ordered this product from Amazon.com on March 7 and I still haven't got it today(March 15)! Terrible service!The Vantec NexStar GX 3.5 USB External Hard Drive Enclosure is all that was advertised.  Easy to install you hard drive and the built-in USB 2. Hub is really a plus.  Works really well and the internal fan helps to keep the Hard Drive cool.The scanner installed and performed as expected from reading several reviews.  I was able to produce excellent quality scans of slides, negatives, and prints almost immediately.My new receiver with a good antenna attached could not pick up a clean signal from the transmitter that was plugged into my computer that is only about 30 feet away.  Signal had to travel through a wooden floor, but I expected more.  The amount of static that is broadcast made the sound unacceptable.Could be a great product. I don't know if it is, because it wasn't delievered soon enough, so I had to buy something else.Could be a great product. I don't know if it is, because it wasn't delievered soon enough, so I had to buy something else.First it stopped recording DVDs, then it stopped recognizing DVDs it had recorded. Now it doesn't recognize any DVDs. I've had it for about 10 months.The power supply died in ten months. It was covered under warranty but this is a common problem I've come to find out. This shouldn't happen.Our only complaint is that after paying over $300 they do not provide a written manual. It took 79 pages of printing to get the manual.This is a great router! It's going to do wonders for you p2p software! Speeds up your internet and gives good connections. Best router ever made!!Very nice phone, much better than the AT&T one I had before. But no speed dial...or have I not discovered it yet?  Still a good buy.Within 10 days of buying this product, the Lid of the CD player does not close and lock properly. Poor mechanism. Need to get it replaced.The TuneJuice looks very nice, but it worked for around ten minutes before completely failing. I'll now try to go buy the more expensive models, sigh...The Garmin Nuvi is very user friendly (much easier than GPS' that are installed in vehicles). Even in back streets/construction detours, we always find our way!!I bought two of these for my daughters.  The first failed after two days of use (Amazon replaced - thanks!).  The second failed after two months.I tried several unused channels and several plugs in the car and this was the best I could get out of it.  Unusable in my opinion.Nice looking enough to leave on the counter. Great sound for a room or 2. It's just what I was looking for for my xm radio.Very good copier for under $100. Copies are decent. Copy speed is slow but reasonable. This is simply a cheap copier that gets the job done.Mine broke after 4 hours - the text disappeared and all I got was an Hourglass with moving dots - Nice! I am returning it tomorrowThis Microscope is not bad.  The only thing I would let everyone know is the projector doesnt work so great.  Otherwise nice item for the price.Can't go wrong with this if you are looking for a cheap player to play your Napster to go music. Economical and sounds pretty good-great valueUpper end audio quality in ear phones for cheap. I love being able to move and work without them falling out, the accompanying sleeves really work.This printer receives zero stars. The ink door cover was broken right out of the box. The replacement printer was no better. All of a sudden, it stopped printing black. Thinking  the black ink was low, I purchased a new cartridge. It still didn't print in black. Thinking the cartridge I purchased was a defect I bought another one. It still doesn't print black.  The printer goes in the trash, where it belongs. Does anyone need any ink?This product works good . But i recently found that it wont work with USB-Ps2 convertor which i had bought for my wireless keyboard and mice.[...] I used it to record about 5 dvds from my old VHS cassettes. The instruction manual is definitely not the most user-friendly. However, I was able to start using the unit without much delay. The problem started after day 3 when I tried to stop a disk that was being recorded upon. The display said something like "cannot stop recording". I finally unplugged the unit to make it stop. Then I realized that the unit had stopped recognizing any disk and kept saying that all disks (prerecorded ones or the ones thatI had recorded earlier) were blank. Spoke to customer service (you have to try a few times to get thru to someone) and they said the read/write haead was probably malfunctioning. They are going to email me a shipping label to send the unit back for replacement. Shall provide an update on the new unit, if and when I receive one.A VERY nice machine.  It was easy to assemble, and after filling the oil reservoir, it started on the very first pull! It runs very quietly for an engine of this size. Unfortunately for me, I found the same machine for $100 less the day after I ordered it -- Oh well........Like all Creative products, the peformance is amazing, but this product also has too many bugs. My speakers were basically brand new, but by the second time using them, they started producing this irritating "crackling" sound that wouldn't go away. I'm really disappointed with the performance of my speakers and really don't recommend buying them. Maybe my purchase was defective, but they have really disappointed me.I bought this product with great hesitation never thinking it would work as well as it does. It was an easy install and finding an unused frequency was almost as easy. I listened to two weeks worth of podcasts in great clarity all the way to the coast and back again, arrived alert and well-informed! Much more enjoyable than 350 miles with a headset or earpieces.I wrote a negative review about these buds at first, and I guess it got deleted, but I changed my mind! I talked to a friend who just got new buds and he told me that they had to break in for a little bit before they started sounding really good so i just kept listening to these headphones even though they had crappy bass and I was really unimpressed. So I kept listening and now they sound great! and they fit really really well too! I'm so happy i stuck with them cause the sound quality is great. the bass is great and they feel really really nice in my ears. So comfortable. I'm converted! I love 'em!This print server is totally unusable device.  I tried to follow the instructions and nothing worked.  I sent email messages to the manufacturer and got no response.  I even tried to get things to work using IE and manually addressing the device using an assigned TCP/IP address.  All of this failed.  This device sounds like a good idea because of the bi-directional communcation.  Don't be deceived by what sounds good!  Keyspan does not make a viable product and has no technical service.  Save yourself time and frustration.  Don't think of buying this product.Download the *FREE* Gutenprint5 (formerly Gimp Print) and follow the installation directions and you'll be printing in no time (but still not scanning. Oh well.) Colors are very nice, speed is good, no comment on ink usage yet but generics are available online.Installation not as easy as expected.  Required phone call to tech support.  However, after installation, product works good with good range.  Have not had any problems.Merchandise recieved in timely manor, Defective unit. Got return authorization from Myron Global. Returned merchandise - have never heard from them again. Made several attempts to contact directly and thru Ama Zon with no results. $200 loss on my part.Bestest parts of this Purifier: Provides peace of mind Does a good job of purifying smoke (tested with lit matches) Good purifying coverage with left to right sweeping Blows cool air Worstest parts of this Purifier: Cleaning the filters Purifier does not sweep from left to right when turned on (requiring two button pushes)This was almost to good to beleive, but it was real.  It worked perfectly.The unit was delivered promptly.  This mount works well and was easy to install.It really depends on the power-up order, whether this switcher responds to commands.  Sometimes, it won't even respond to the physical buttons on its face, let alone the remote control, necessitating a "hard reboot" -pulling the power cord- before it responds. Not a high-quality circuit board, I fear.He LOVES it.  Has thanked me a hundred times already.  He is mid 20s and is fairly adept in electronic gadgets.  Sound quality is great; ease of use is medium.  Some aspects of the equipment are pretty much learn as you go.  Downloading is easy.  Excellent value!One of the most horrible products I have ever owned.  It died in just 4 months of usage.  Never buy this productGreat front carrier!  I found the lumbar support much more comfortable than the old style that I used with my first child.  My back is thankful.Bought this so that my work-from-home wife can use both her laptop and her desktop at the same time.  High quality, sturdy, attractive, and very functional.  Better product at lower cost than what I could find at local store.  Highly recommend.After 1 week of use, this fan started making a high-pitched noise and then stopped working altogether after one more day.  I would NOT recommend this fan to anyone.  Even when it did work, the air output was minimial at best.Great protection - and the holster is actually very good. The ipod does not shift even when i go jogging!My first Coby 7" lasted 8 months until the picture failed - began to roll uncontrollably. My second Coby 7" lasted two months - it 'smoked'the back plastic panel - melting the plastic. The sound is atrocious - you must use a set of Computer powered speakers. The picture - when the set is working - is Brilliant - none better.My first Coby 7" lasted 8 months until the picture failed - began to roll uncontrollably.

The picture - when the set is working - is Brilliant - none better.Bought this to digitize vinyl and after quite a bit of frustration broke down and consulted Griffin's website.  They have a FAQ response that states that the hardware is not compatable with VISTA.  Back to the drawing board. I'm sure it's a great product for Macs and XP.Bought one, found  it defective with first dvd, returned it next day.  Received second unit, also defective first try, but other symptoms, returned that the next day.  Bought a third player, different brand! Got to hand it to Amazon, though, no hassle return policy had the second dvd player on the way to me before they had received the first one back. You can't find a better place to shop!Bought one, found  it defective with first dvd, returned it next day.

You can't find a better place to shop!I've never had so much trouble with DVD-R media as with these.  I've used about a third of my spindle, and at least half of them had to be thrown away because of media errors.  I thought TDK made bad discs, but these really take the cake.  Never, ever buying these again.  Save yourself a lot of hassle and frustration and avoid these discs.Plugged it in. Got good sound, but no video. Tried a different input on my receiver. Still no video. Plugged it directly into my TV. No video. Tried the receiver again. The sound was terrible. Then the thing blew. I could smell fried circuit board immediately. I'm just glad it didn't fry my iPod too. P.O.S.I purchased these earphones on the basis of the many positive reviews. Worst earphones I've ever experienced. I asked two friends to try them just to get their feedback - worst earphones they ever used. After having the Bose headphones I didn't expect that quality but they are awful. I purchased these to have a set of earbud style in addition to the Bose. Returned them two days later and purchased some high-end Sony earbuds that are great. Even the construction of these with the ridiculous wiring looks like someone made them in their garage. Buy Bose or Sony but avoid these and don't buy into the reviews... something is wrong here.I ordered this unit and Amazon, great as ever, delivered in under 24hrs (shipped from adjacent state) with just super saver free shipping.  Unfortunately, the unit was running scorching hot after about an hour of use.  I felt behind and found the fan wasn't working.  I double checked visually and could see the fan twitching ever so slightly but not actually running.  I am currently packing it up to return to Amazon.  Shame, the unit seemed like it was solidly built and worked good on the two discs I tried on it (Memorex RW+ 2.4x and Ridata RW+ 4x).  Due to other poor reviewes I decided not to exchange and hope for a good unit.  Even with the fan not running I think this unit should not have been running so hot; it was uncomfortable to the touch.  Heat is the enemy of electronics.  I doubt this thing would have lasted more than a few weeks of use.First disk did not work properly after recording - skipped, audio was not synchronized with the video. The second one was fine. LightScribe takes very long to draw an image.  I don't see myself using LightScribe in the future.I installed Systemworks 2006 about ten days ago, and for ten days have been struggling with why my computer often takes several minutes to start up, and usually crashes on Shutdown. After wasting perhaps 12 hours scanning the Internet for solutions to Shutdown problems, and trying different fixes, I finally tried turning off GoBack. Voila! So I figured I'd go back to NSW 2005. There my troubles began. Uninstalling 2006 and reinstalling 2005 crashed in the middle of GoBack installation, trashing parts of my Registry and numerous system files. Getting rid of the partly installed GoBack and getting the system running again (I have yet to completely restore the Registry) has so far taken me another six hours. Don't risk it. Don't buy it. - David, in Gloucester, MAThis is my first running watch I purchased, very easy to operate, very helpfull training for the NYC marathon. Amazon was great to purchase from, just a great experince.I simply could not get it to find satellites often.  I went through any and all of the troubleshooting steps I could find online and the device only seemed to occasionally function properly.  It's not very useful and I just yesterday shipped it back to Amazon.  Unfortunately, since I took so much time trying to work with it, I've past the normal return time and could pay a hefty restocking fee.  An overall disappointing experience.Light weight, great design, great sound, easy to use... comes with armband and battery... it worths every penny paid.I bought this iPod because my mini didn't hold enough songs for me.  After buying this my life is complete!  The videos play well and the songs sound great.  It has locked up a few times, but came back really fast.  The black is kind of hard to keep clean, but I just dropped it really hard about an hour ago and it is still working just fine...I would recommend this to everyone, but if you have a cleaning disorder I suggest getting the white one!People who think these sound good must not have ever had a decent pair. I'm coming from a pair of Sony MDR-EX51 that sounds really nice. These sound tinny and as if you were listening through fabric. Horrid, just horrid.Does a good job but the adhesive supplied to attache it to the truck is not up to the job.  The easy fix is to attached it with SS screws. Even adding the screws (excluding time to go buy them) the install was less than 45 minutes. UPDATE:  6 months use now and working just fine!My own 2-year-old Sansa was accidentally broken, and since I really liked the way it worked, I wanted another.  Paying full-price seemed a bit high at this point, so I decided to go with a refurbished for the savings.  The one I got works well, just not as good as a new one (or as good as the one I had had).  There's a small problem with the volume control changing on its own, which is a continual irritant, but not life-threatening.The Panasonic recorder has done a great job of recording shows from cable and recording them to DVD.  The manual can be somewhat confusing, however, and the TV Guide screen is maddening!Great battery life, easy to navigate, huge hard drive, great sound quality.  Really no negatives about it.  It's about the size of a credit card, only thicker.  Great, great purchase.Great battery life, easy to navigate, huge hard drive, great sound quality.  Really no negatives about it.  It's about the size of a credit card, only thicker.  Great, great purchase.Better impossible. My Ipod is protected completely. Protected against scratches, water, etc. I recomended it.This is my worst ever online purchase. It arrived already broken & never worked. The seller was TOTALLY unhelpful & VERY VERY rude! When I brought it to my local computer repair shop, they told me that it was sub-standard junk & not worth fixing.I did lots of reading before I bought this printer. this is just great one.I ordered. It came on time.  That's what I expected and that's what I got.This one works OK until now, however there is some background noise for MP3 songs.Very good price, easy to mount and good if you want multiple point of view.I bought it because of it's antenna, it's excellent. For my job it works well.Great product!!  Only negative is the cover for the computer/USB connector.  Good value for price.Good product, but make sure that the transmitter/power outlet is close to the car's radio.Worked like a dream on my recent trip to TAnzania. I took several of them.this is the best gps i have ever used.if i could i would buy another.I tried to install the software several times, but was always given the message that "you cannot access this key". I need to use this soon!!! This is so frustrating!!!Nice pictures, good price, bring me total different feeling comparing with my other digi cameras.I know the product, and use it regularly - good price for an additional license.Easy-to-follow instructions for installation.  Unfortunately, battery died 6 months later... I bought this as a long term replacement, not as a quick fix.  I recommend going with a different option.Nice pictures, good price, bring me total different feeling comparing with my other digi cameras.This product is great as it was very easy to use and install great vendorThis product is great as it was very easy to use and install great vendornot the bose unit quality but great for the money.  perfect for normal volume use...This one works OK until now, however there is some background noise for MP3 songs.This is a great MP3 player!  It's the perfect size and a really good price!They last a LONG time and do not leak. Beautiful and fun writing. Cheap too!Excellent value. Great price, sturdy and well made. Will support my 23" LCD just fine.Great unit with alot of features. I would go to [...] for the same unit. You can buy it new for $259.99 versus what Amazon's best used/refurbished/new price is. Lawerenceproduct is straight forward and easy to use. I bought one for my child and really liked the features and the easy use so I bought one for myself too.helped me manage my small business, however, they just came out with a new versionGot the card and it's worked just fine.  I've used it for about 6 months.This is a great monitor. It works great and the sound quality is excellent. I have bought numerous baby monitors in the past and this is the best one yet.First one it's has many interference. Second, connectors are so weak and need a support.The best thing for protecting your  CDs, DVDs or Game disk currently on the market.Easy to install 100% compatible. Much more convinient then the one that came with GPS.The sation does everything that I expected, and it produces pretty good sound as well.Easy to install 100% compatible. Much more convinient then the one that came with GPS.It's nearly perfect. I hope the voice information should be a litter earlier than present.I really liked this product. It's very user friendly. I would recommend it to anyone.The first one worked fine until video outputs stopped working after a month. The replacement unit worked for a few weeks and now it will not read or play DVD of any type, even rented or purchased movies.  A lot of features but poor quality.The first one worked fine until video outputs stopped working after a month. The replacement unit worked for a few weeks and now it will not read or play DVD of any type, even rented or purchased movies.  A lot of features but poor quality.This GPS is great, its very easy to use no issues with it. It arrived the next day even though I opted for regular shipping and it was properly packaged. I wish you could control the volume external though. Its a nice product, get it.I bought one a couple of years ago to backup my home computers. (Mac OS X) It works like a dream. Quick backups and easy software to install. Highly recommend.was able to power my furnace, sump pump light and more simultaneously.  works as expected.Very easy to set up and use.  One of the best external hard drives I've used.  The premium edition came with backup software that is also very easy to use.This was in fact the BEST radio ever....sound is excellent, convenience can't compare and a remote!!  My husband is very finicky and this was one of the BEST products...highly recommend.I have $5 earbuds that sound better than these.  I was hoping for an exciting new audio experience. sigh. Buy the Shure E series or Bose earbuds instead, I did.Camera is great. Love it. Wasted almost my whole first roll because I should of used the flash more. The lens doesn't seem to grab as much light as a regular lense, so use the flash often. Total user error though. Camera is awesome. Enjoy!This is a straightforward black and white printer with no frills.  It works just fine!Last minute order and I got xd card in time before my travel begin. thanks!i got this free with earbuds i bought at amazon. it held 97 songs for me. easy to use after i played around with it(did not come with manual but was easy enough to figure out.) works well..not alot of frills like the creative zen or ipod graphics, but then not much on it that can go wrong either. i liked it well enough that i am buying my son the 4 gig sansa, since he is on his 3rd dell dj(made by creative) and the ipods get bad reviews.Everything works as described.  Shipped when it was supposed to.  Wish everything was that efficient!I used to love these bottles until the nipple collapsed twice while feeding my 4 month old daughter, causing almost the entire bottle to spill in her mouth and nose.  The first time it happened I thought I didn't screw the top on, but then it happened again.  After doing some research, this is a common problem with these bottles.My Toshiba 62HM95 DLP TV started making a loud buzzing or fan noise. I had an authorized Toshiba repair center come out to look at it and they determined it requires a new optic engine which has the color wheel. Total price of repair is $730.30. I've already had to replace the lamp unit far before it's advertised life expectancy. I called Toshiba and they said too bad. I will never buy another Toshiba product.Another great product from one of the better brands being Sylvania.Got what I expected.Very satisfied.i am very pleased with this keyboard.  it is better than expected, with good sound, many features, and low price. one comment about the A/C adapter.  it was too cleverly hidden among the packing and we almost missed it, actually threw the box away and had to retrieve it.  if the shipper would put a note or arrow on the piece of packing where it is hidden, that would probably help.I bought this tv 11 days ago, today march 21st, 2006 the top half of the screen went a little fuzzy and then faded out completely. Nice huh ? [...]For the price, they work great. The cord isn't too short or too long. The mic stem(?) is kinda long, but it seems to pickup my voice better than others. They may hurt your ears after wearing awhile though. Maybe I just have big ears..This product worked perfectly at first. On our most recent road trip, however, the fan died and the unit would constantly overheat. It would stop outputting power, unless I kept it directly in front of an AC vent. I remember the fan being loud before, but now I cant even hear it.i'll gladly save money and take a dented box item - works perfect.It completely sucks. The software starts scanning and then gets stuck "not responding", when I finally got it to scan it never found any of the pictures I recently lost, I tried to use the "recover" feature but it was not responding after it finished scanning. A complete pain in the ass, lost my money, never got the pictures or files I wanted. It scans things you have been looking at in the computer, so if you were reading about a movie or looking at some clothes recently, that is what you will recover.From the first day I bought this, the DVD door/flap didn't work.  I had to either nudge it with my fingers or hit the open/close button several times for it to work.  I didn't mind much at first since it otherwise worked well at first.  Now, it won't even record anything to DVD - current or old TV shows, anything from VHS, even old family movies.  Take a look around on the 'net and check out Go Video's reputation.  Learn from the mistakes of others (like mine) and do not buy this, or anything they make.As a regular stove-top espresso drinker with many bialetti's in my kitchen, I also wanted this product to work very much, read all the reviews and was prepared to be patient and to try many times. Unfortunately, over the course of using it every day for 2 months and getting about 20/100 good cups of cappucino-like beverage, I ended up returning it not because I wasn't willing to continue figuring out why it often leaked all over the place, wasn't hot enough, didn't froth, burnt coffee, or didn't make enough espresso, but rather because it stopped working entirely!! The machine just refused to pump espresso up no matter how much troubleshooting I dutifully attempted. The 20 cups I did manage to make were pretty good, but really I tried every variation of the steps and after wasting so much of my precious bean...really who has the time for this?  Really disappointing.This player worked GREAT!!.. at first! I'd seen some reviews about this player stating that it just stopped working, but bought one anyways thinking that mine would somehow be different. Three weeks later it randomly just began freezing when I turned the player on... Luckily it was still within Amazon's return time limit, so I had it replaced.. BIG MISTAKE.. i should have gotten a refund!! Four months later (Way out of the return time frame), my "new" player began to do the same thing!! For the last month and a half I tried emailing Sansa's "customer service" email address, and haven't gotten a single response. This is the worst thing you could spend your money on!! Other people give it great ratings, but that's because they haven't had it long enough for it to break down on them!! Now I've spent 70 bucks and have nothing to show for it... Take my advice and get something else!!great gadget.  only thing i've seen annoying about it was having to remain completely still in order to get picked up by the satellites sometimes.  o and there's no back light or i haven't found it yet so you can't see the display when running at night.  great for monitoring your training and pushing yourself harder.  barely feel it on my arm while running.It's very complicated to connect in! It's keep broken everytime i tried to connect in my car. It's finally broken when it was on fired... The connector fell of and touched the cicrete thingy.. and somehow it was on fire..I bought this machine primarily to transfer my old VHS tapes to DVD.The first thing I noticed was the tiny remote control.The thing is so small that it takes a flat watch type battery...like I`ve got a drawerfull of those laying around as spares...whatever..The remote has alot of buttons but they are too small and close together..very unhandy.Once you figure out how to operate the recorder it actually works..however,there are quite a few problems.First of all it will simply stop recording for no apparant reason. When you are done recording and try to finalize the disc,you often get an error message..All the time spent recording is wasted because now the disc is ruined...I made several coasters and mini frisbees.I seemed to be having better luck with a different brand of blank disc..only to find that recording from a satellite produced no sound..picture looked ok but what good is that without sound?...Ah..the things they forget to tell you..Even just playing a disc this machine has problems.Sometimes the disc will freeze...sound cuts out sometimes too. Plus the machine runs very hot....In conclusion I`d say you should take heed these reviews...most of them are crumby...Spend more $$ on a good name brand unit...I`m still searching .We began using this tub when our son was about 7-months old. Worked great for us. He is 1-year-old now. We just use it when we go on vacation to keep him from sitting in hotel/condo tubs. Still works great for that purpose. Easy to use, easy to clean.My shipmet is missing Aynet Devise !!!I will gladly review it once I get it. Urgent!!!----My shipmet is missing Aynet Devise !!!I will gladly review it once I get it. Urgent!!!----This mp3 player never worked properly.  After searching the web for solutions, downloading "updates", and changing various settings, I gave up and returned it to Amazon.  They refunded my money promptly.  I replaced it with the iRiver Gen 2. It works great and has much better features as well.great product! and a great deal going on right now with the discounted price...for whatever reason the specs on Amazon.com describe this product as not being Mac compatible. THIS IS NOT ACCURATE, as I'm currently using it on mine. Hopefully this will get sorted out by the Amazon folks.Pros - nice sound, great look cons - display is TOO BRIGHT, I have to cover it to sleep - cd starts at first song, even when snoozing starts at the beginning of the first song. - can't set volume level of buzzer - cd broke after 4 monthsNeed a magnifying glass to read the text on the screen. Very unfriendly controls. To make it complete, it didn't function properly. Have to send it back to manufacturer and hope for the best since Amazon's return ploicy on open items isn't very nice. Stay away from this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!I loved it to for about 4 months and then it wont play any dvd's unknown disc it says!! I paid full price for mine. Called customer service they told me to buy a disc cleaner before they would help me, bought one and it didn't help. Called back and they had disconnected the number!! VERY BAD COMPANY!!! NEVER BUY FROM GO VIDEO!!!!The first UPS500 I received was defective, after receiving the second unit and installing per Monster instructions, The UPS-500 works great. Thank you Amazon.com for all the support you gave me. Thanks; JerryYou are NOT going to get a free map update! If you were told by Garmin tech support (as I was) that you could go ahead and buy the device with the v8 maps and you would be provided with a free map upgrade YOU WERE LIED TO! You were expected to notice (according to Garmin) that this long standing update policy had been changed. If you still insist on throwing your hard-earned money at a company that behaves this way at least wait until all the old stock has been flushed from the distribution system before buying and then only purchase from a retailer that will assure you that you are getting the new updated maps.From what I can tell, these last nearly as long as alkaline batteries in remotes and wireless mice.  Plus, they seem to hold a charge if they're charged up but not used right away.This is the third PAL radio I've purchased.  Love it so much had to get one for my son.  It has amazing sound and the battery lasts a long time.  Would highly recommend it!Nothing but troubles with McAfee....don't do it! Came "free" with new computer. Screwed up my whole system. Went back to Norton Anti-virus and am 100% satisfied. All my problems went away when uninstalling McAfee.this product is the worst made enclosure i have seen. it doesnt go together right, the screws are to short, but for the price i guess what can u expect; at least it works.I bought my cartridges here becuase it is cheaper then anywhere else I have found plus I get free shipping! And of course they work just fine and last a pretty long time too.I love the sound, and noise cancelling of these phones. But, one day they just broke in two pieces, and shorted out. Tape wouldn't even work. This was frustrating for the price I paid.I love this player...it is replacing a previous one I lost.  I received the product in exactly the amount of time I was told.  It was in excellent condition containing everything the description said.Multi Directional, Bright, Takes up minimal Outlit space, Provides enough light to navigate in the bathroom, bedroom & kitchen w/out turning on more energy using main lights at night! Recommended to Friends & FamilyThe Amazon description states this unit has S-Video which is incorrect. This receiver is a great value otherwise.Thought the price was high, but after receiveing it I found it to be of the high'est quality.Great product - very easy to set up and use.  One plus would be to specify the end address at the beginning, because it is easy to select the wrong one from a list.I received the bundle but there is no installation key for Shade LE. I noticed the someone else's review stating this same problem is no longer visible so I figured I'd post it again.(Based on Microsoft Subscription Final Release Product.  Tested December 2005) Lots of nifty features, but unfortunately it needs a few more months of development before it will really be stable.  They say a serious update will be coming out sometime in mid 2006.  Hopefully the problems with hangups, corrupted project files, and the maddeningly slow text input will be fixed then, so we can start to do some serious programming with this potentially very exciting product.Love the phone but am finding that while it is plugged into the computer, the console is logging messages at the rate of around 10 a second (2 shown below): 2006-07-02 16:18:53.433 free-1 USB Phone[89] AUDIO_IN AppleUSBAudioEngine:?:Free-1 USB Phone:3d100000:2 2006-07-02 16:18:53.533 free-1 USB Phone[89] AUDIO_OUT AppleUSBAudioEngine:?:Free-1 USB Phone:3d100000:1 That's around 60kB per minute...Horroable ring tune! Very short battery life, 40 minutes talking at night and next morning battery dies! System crash every 2 days, needs to reboot! During taling phone getting very hot(after talking for 1 hour my ear feels like burning) After one week totally stoping working and become a piece of plastic JUNK!I found my memory card best with a good price that I bought last month from Amazon...It has good memory and worked fine. I like the packing too when I got it. And it reached to me earlier than the date given to me to receive. So I really like Amazon and will buy my other items from Amazon too in future..thanx for giving me a good thing. I really appreciated it.This case scratched up the back of my iPod really badly because of the slide-on mechanism.  Kind of ironic because the whole point of a case is to keep your iPod from getting scratched!!I bought this scanner after returning a higher end flatbed scanner that was not sending enough light through the 35 mm slides I was scanning.  This scanner does a good job and allows me to brighten up most all of the darker or poorly taken slides. The software is fairly easy to use although I would like to see an automatic program to clean up imperfections as the manual program takes quite a bit of time and work.  The scanner does tend to slow down after completing about 100 slides at one sitting, but has continued to work fineDon't waste your time with this item.  The original iTrip is much better, but still not as good as a basic cassette adapter.  Can never find a clear channel, the LX/DX does not make any improvement in the signal strength which is really weak coming out of the unit.  The engrs that designed this thing really over compressed the sound - horrible range...AM is much better sounding.  Stay away from this product!I got these headphones as a gift, and for the first few months they were amazing!  I've never heard better sound from headphones, and they fit in my ears perfectly.  However, after five months, the sound started to get fuzzy, and the right earbud went out a week later.  Deciding to give them another try, I bought a second pair to replace the first.  But sure enough, four months later, the same EXACT thing occured.  So, great sound and incredibly comfortable, but you might have to replace them every few months.Easy installation, love the Cicso security features and great wireless range from up to 3 floors making this a great investment. Compatible with WEP, WPA and more additional wireless modes for new or old wifi devices. Highly recommended!The speakers are plenty loud for a laptop computer. Sometimes the sound is funky depending upon the medium that you're playing. Things may sound too high pitched or too flat, which will result in you changing the EQ quite a lot. While that gets annoying after awhile, it isn't a big enough deal to make me want to get rid of the speakers. The price was right, and if you have the EQ adjusted properly the sound is right also. Oh, and the bass is pretty decent for such low wattage! I'd recommend these, but if you're looking for the next step up I recommend the Klipsch 2.1 system ([.......]).The good news is that the device does humidify the air pretty well. And mine is not noisy, apparently unlike some other units reviewed here. The bad news is that the quality and design are both poor, making the device difficult to clean, difficult to refill, and difficult to trust. I do not recommend this humidifier.we liked the first one so much we got a second as a back up for whenever the other is in the wash.  perfect for temperature changes when taking baby to overly air-conditioned restaurants on hot days.THIS SOFTWARE REALLY LOOKS GREAT.THE FISH LOOK VERY LIFE LIKE.THE GREAT WHITE COMES RIGHT OUT AT YOU WHILE SWIMMING.IF YOU LIKE LOOKING AT SHARKS THIS IS THE SOFTWARE TO GET.I purchased a refurbished Boston Acoustics Receptor HD Radio from Beach Audio. It was defective when I received it. I notified Beach Audio, got a Return Authorization Number from them, sent it back and received a refund immediately. A reputable seller, in my opinion.I've been using Verbatim for many years. On both DVD and CD, I've bought more than 20 spindles, but I rarely have problem with burning. I will keep using it!!I purchased two copies of the software. One copy installed correctly on a new laptop. When I tried to install the second copy on a desktop on which I had previously used it, it said I already had a later version installed. Now I am having problems with the previous subscription vs. the new upgrade I purchased.I was working on a huge client project last month. My son borrowed my laptop an somehow the file got "lost". I used Recover Lost Data and saved myself hours of headaches and humiliation. Works like a charm!Excellent buy for this great USB Flash Drive.  Item was shipped promptly.  I would definately consider buying from again.The mouse works really great. I love it. Nothing has gone wrong with it. It also looks really great.Easy to install, supports my lcd 14" and doesnt need anything else to install'. Great option and great price.
