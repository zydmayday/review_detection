Vino en buenas condiciones y es peque?o, cabe en la mano.... Lo recomiendo para corredores de media maraton, acaso piensan gastar 1GB de m?sica en todo el recorrido? lo dudo!Estoy muy contento con la c?mara, el ?nico defecto que le he encontrado es que el volumen al grabar video MPEG4 es exageradamente bajo....  parecen pel?culas mudas y ruidosas.  Por lo dem?s es muy buena.O rel?gio ? muito bom, facil de configurar e muito f?cil de ser usado. Os mapas podem ser transferidos para a web onde ? poss?vel fazer uma an?lise de todo o exerc?cio. ?nico se n?o fica por conta do tamanho, ele ? um pouco grande e precisa de um tempo de adapta??o para correr com ele no pulso, mais voc? acaba acostumando.El trasmisor funciona bien.

Simplemente perfecto!!esta es mi segunda compra y la verdad no tengo queja ya que he adquirido articulos electronicos que es un poco delicardos comprarlos por este medio, pero no he tenido ningun problema y los invito a comprar en amazon su compra estara segura y garantizadaFoi uma de minhas melhores aquisi??es dos ?ltimos tempos. O custo benef?cio ? excelente... A operacionalidade do aparelho ? bastante simples. Os recursos s?o excelentes, a sincroniza??o de faixas ? muito simples e o aparelho ainda ? bonito. Al?m disso a op??o do slot de expans?o ? bastante ?til. Reproduz v?rios formatos de ?udio, al?m de fotos, v?deos, R?dio e gravador (o gravador funciona inclusive no r?dio). Bom mesmo.Humorous, romantic, quirky, melodic: Tim Burton and Co. push this right buttons again in this feel ghoulish romp thru both sides of life.  Perfect for a family movie night or for a couple to share.Excelente creo  que  no  hay que  hablar  mucho  de ello, su capacidad lo dice todo.......Comprenla son problema simpre llenara sus requisitos....If they don't have any sizes in stock, and they don't then what's the point?A persar de que las comparaciones son odiosas, al ver esta pel?cula surgen constantemente las comparaciones con "Pesadilla antes de Navidad" (PADN). En mi opini?n no llega a tener el ritmo ni la profundidad en la historia que ?sta ?ltima. Aunque a nivel de imagen considero que los a?os han pasado a favor de la "Novia Cad?ver" lo cierto es que ni en la historia ni en la m?sica alcanza las cotas de PADN. La m?sica es muy parecida y la historia es bastante m?s floja y mucho m?s predecible. Hay elementos como el perro del protagonista en el Inframundo que son como el perro de PADN. A pesar de todo estoy muy satisfecho con la compra de este DVD y la recomiendo encarecidamente. Respecto a los Extras, te enteras de algunos detalles pero tampoco aportan gran cosa. Lo que s? me ha gustado mucho ha sido la opci?n de poder ver la pel?cula solo con la banda sonora.if you're a fan of the ipod you won't be disapointed. i love mine.En realidad no me parece un producto que valga la pena. Tienes que tener el iPod encima del radio para que puedas escuchar bien la Musica. No lo volveria a comprar.Muy buena, muy rapida y a un exelente precio, que mas se le puede pedir a una memoria.Fits like a glove and works like a champ. No chasing availability from store to store Thank You AmazonMucho mejor de lo esperado el producto, muy f?cil de navegaci?n, de cargar la m?sica y en men? muy intuitivo, lo ?nico medio molestoso son los aud?fonos, un tanto inc?modos, pero cuesti?n de adaptarse. RecomendableIt must be explicit with de color name... or linkeableDid not work in my car (2006 Toyota Corolla) but it did work in my wife's 2003 Highlander (I'm only in my wife's vehicle about once a week).

For 5 times I refilled the tanks, only 2 times works. I return it, this should go to the junk yard.Excelente telefono, por eso se gano todos esos premios, lo unico malo es que lo meti en la lavadora de ropa y hasta ese momento duro.la c?mara es incre?ble, pero el lente al ser un Zoom no es muy luminoso, por lo que hay que compensar con el iso de la c?mara, incluso 1600, pero ah? la imagen pierde nitidez aparece el grano.I've had no problems with this SD card.  I like the fact that it has a lifetime warranty. It performs everytime and the price is very good.Just another note for the Nokia 770. Works like a charm. Buy a few and carry some movies with you on the plane.Lo compre para no perderme en unas vacaciones por tierra en Estados Unidos. Excelentes Resultados.Este reproductor de mp3 es muy bueno si lo que te interesa es tener memoria disponible y ejercitarte.  El precio es bastante accesible y definitivamente es mas fuerte que el Ipod shuffle. Milward (Panama, Central America)DCan't wait to use it... I am a very anxious driver, but can't wait to use my Garmin!!!!!!!i need to now abuot the phone wich have three Handsets.Cuando compre era la mejor bateria aaa  que hab?a al mejor precio. La calidad y duraci?n son excelentes. Recomiendo ?nicamente la compra de ?sta o de la energizer, son las mejores. No desperdicien su dinero en otras marcar. Por ultimo quiero dejar en claro que le he puesto cuatro estrellas y no cinco porque una semana despu?s de haber comprado encontre (no en amazon) que ya existe la de 1000 mA que no hab?a ac?. Busquela por las dudas antes de comprar.after 2 weeks, vhs tapes were being eaten, then refused to cough them up - and other maladies that i don't have time to go into.my 2nd disc choice if my 1st one is out i love this item and company!!Anyone that does graphics or has muliple monitors will find this mousepad indespensible.Los Motorola Talkabout FV200AA GMRS son muy buenos equipos considerando su bajo precio. Los hemos utilizado en una distancia de aproximadamente 500 metros en l?nea vista en la ciudad y la recepci?n es muy buena. A 200 metros en la ciudad sin linea vista la senal se pierde. Los compre para mis hijas con el objetivo de ubicarlas en espacios abiertos en un rango de 250 metros y para este uso funcionan muy bien.Reci?n lo he comprado.  Tenia muchas dudas si comprarlo o no.  Por que habia leido en los review, que se demoraba mucho para bajar las fotos. A penas lo compr? y despu?s de cargarlo, lo primero que hice fue probarlo.  Le meti una tarjeta SD que tenia y le baje las fotos.  Me pareci? que bajo rapidamente, no es lento ni rapido, podria decir que se demora lo que uno se demora cuando bajas la informacion a la computadora. Me gusta por que es peque?o pero algo pesadito. Lo que mas me gusta de esto, es que te sirve para bajar las fotos de tus tarjetas de memoria sin el uso de una computadora.  Es muy ?til cuando uno sale de viaje o quiz?s cuando est?s en una reuni?n y un amigo toma una foto que quisieras, simplemente le pides que te preste la tarjeta y lo bajas en tu wolverine. Lo tengo poco tiempo, as? que todav?a no le he encontrado algo que no me guste (si es que lo tiene)Excelente idea de hacer unos altavoces que mejoraran un poco el sonido de la consola PSP. El unico inconveniente que le veo es que si tambien tienes el cargador - asidero, no vas a poder usar ambos porque ocupan espacios iguales. Es por esto que se hace dificil cargar con ambos accesorios al  mismo tiempo.Plug your iPod in, and watch it get destroyed.  This product should be withdrawn from the market.If your iPod has rounded corners (like the one in the image on this page) it should fit without any trouble, but if the corners are squared off, it won't fit.Es buenisimo, tiene una excelente calidad de sonido la duracion de las baterias es buena mas de 16 horasIn terms of quality and performance the Garmin GPSMap 60CSx is superb.Econ?mico, ligero, y veloz. Soy profesor y requer?a un scannner peque?o y port?til que me permitiera subir con facilidad im?genes y materiales impresos a mi p?gina web. El LiDe 25 ha satisfecho de manera eficiente esta necesidad. Es port?til y c?modo de usar debido a que no requiere de fuente de poder. El software de reconocimiento de textos es muy eficiente, por lo que resulta sencillo convertir textos digitalizados a documentos Word. Su dise?o es moderno y atractivo, y su funcionamiento silencioso. Estoy muy satisfecho con mi adquisici?n.trabaja bien sirve de ayuda en el control del bebe es de 110 voltios y yo lo queria en 220 pero lo resolvi con un transformadorEste juego de fitros es una excelente opcion de compra para la calidad que tienen,cada uno cumple su trabajo a cabalidad;enroscan perfectamente en los 58 mm para los que fueron dise?ados,tiene su rosca macho que va al cuerpo de la camara o adaptador y rosca hembra,para recibir otro filtro adicional o un filtro de uso diario para protejer al que dejamos fijo en la camara,(casi siempre el uv;en mi caso.) Recomiendo altamente esta marca. espero que les sea de ayuda mi opinion. Exitos!Me deshice de 3 controles para quedarme solo con este. Controla perfectamente  TV Toshiba, DVD Sony y Audio Amp/Tuner Sony. Me sucedi? que algun codigo no controlaba todas las funciones del aparato, solo es de seguir buscando otro codigo de los que estan en lista y encontrar?n uno que si controle todo.Mcafee does not acknowledge that rebate materials have been submitted or they deny the rebate and delay...etc.these are my staple DVD's for family distribution and I don't have to use marking pen.Compre la rebel xt primero por el precio, soy dise?ador gr?fico y trabajo con webs, y esta camara tiene suficiente poder para dedicarme solo a la fotografia profesional. He usado antes camaras canon y son muy buenas pero esta es una buena opcion para quienes inician en la fotografia profesional o fotografos mas avanzados. Tiene 5 puntos de enfoque que se pueden manipular para lograr efectos muy buenos, y una rafaga de disparos continuos de unos 12 disparos en unos 2a3 seg. Como detalle tambien les aclaro que el lente ef-s 18-55 que trae se queda corto para hacer acercamientos entonces tengan por seguro que tendran que adquirir otro lente. Otras baterias tambien son otra buena opcion para comprar puesto que si usan mucho el screen para revisar las fotografias se consumen bastante rapido.  Bueno, la verdad yo si la recomiendo.El pen drive es de buena calidad, practico y facil de manejar, la velocidad de lectura y escritura es excelente. Recomiendo este productoLo que me gusto de este control remoto es la programaci?n a treves de la pc, sin embargo me desencanto un poco pues la interfas de usuario no es la idonea, pero al conocer el  programa me diverti agregando mis dispositivos y las actividades. Lo que no me gusto es el material de la carcasa es muy delicado y facil de da?ar, espero no romperlo tan pronto, hubiera sido mejor si le con material para absorver golpes. A la hora de usarlo con mi Centro de Entretemiento en general me siento satisfecho.the drivers crash all the time with my windows mobile opperating system AND I CANT SEEM Tto get any othersExelente producto por DFI. Lo recomiendo 100%. el CMOS del BIOS es impresionantemente cofigurable. Nada dif?cil de ajustarlo a nuestras necesidades. No da problemas para instalar RAID's en Windows XP. Trae hasta una herramienta para sacar Jumpers. La refrigeraci?n es muy buena, tal vez un poco ruidozo el FAN del NB, pero del resto trae disipaci?n pasiva. :) Me gust? mucho esta tarjeta madre. L?stima que no la adquir? en vez de la MSI NEO4 Platinum que esta si que me dio todos los problemas del mundo. NO SE LA RECOMIENDO A NADIE. MSI Ha bajado calidad en sus productos. Lo siento por ellos.i bought this mp3 player for my sister and she loves it. although there was a problem with the headphones but se managed to work it out by herself.Soy un usuario un poco mas que amateur y mucho menos que profesional y esta camara me resulta realmente extraordinaria. Una gran cantidad de opciones y lo mas importante con una gran calidad!!! Estoy tomando mi primer curso de fotografia y la verdad cada vez me demuestra que es una gran camara. 100% recomendada.Es un excelente producto y funciona bien. Lo tengo instalado en Costa Rica. Al principio tuve algunos problemas, pero adquir? un nuevo router, de los recomendados por Slingmedia y solicit? a mi proveedor de internet que abrieran los puertos y listo. Cero problemas. Eso s?, se debe de tener acceso a mas 512 kbs, para que se pueda ver bien fuera de casa. Para aquellos que tienen wireless es una bonita opci?n para tener tv en cualquier parte de la casa.Existen otras herramientas en las que los diagramas de flujo ayudan a organizar las actividades en un proyecto de investigaci?n, pero ninguna iguala a Inspiration en cuanto a la capacidad de plasmar conceptos y actividades en forma gr?fica.

Comprei um ipod video 30G no amazon e correu tudo ?s mil maravilhas, desde a simplicidade de compra, ao cumprimento dos prazos de entrega. Tive uma pequena ajuda...um amigo que vive nos estates recebeu a minha encomenda e trouxe-a para Portugal (obrigado Diogo). O pre?o ? muitissimo competitivo (bem mais barato que c?) e o material chegou em perfeitas condi?oes. Um abra?o a todos e ...bom som!!!This is one of the most usefull products in my arsenal. I love it.Tuve el placer de escuchar el Hifi de Apple, el Onstage de JBL (muy bueno pero carece de control remoto), el BOSE y el Klipsh IGroove. Termine comprando el IGroove. Definitivamente el mejor entre los anteriormente nombrados. Ahora bien, tiempo despues, vi el Klipsh IFI por internet. Me llamo la atencion por que tiene Subwoofer. Siempre me ha gustado el toque que le da el subwoofer a la musica, de manera pues que no me pude aguantar y lo compre. Este es definititivamente el mejor de los mejores. La calidad del sonido es espectacular. Si tienen el dinero y el espacio (es mas grande que los anteriormente nombrados) no les quepa la menor duda de que este es el mejor equipo que le puedes colocar a tu IPOD. Lo recomiendo ampliamente.Tuve el placer de escuchar el Hifi de Apple, el Onstage de JBL (muy bueno pero carece de control remoto), el BOSE y el Klipsh IGroove. Termine comprando el IGroove.

Si bien es cierto, existen presentaciones con mejores rates en estos aspectos, la Extreme III es excelente. Personalmente manejo varias memorias de 2 o 4 Gb y la Extreme III se presta para esto La recomiendo.I had to return this recorder. I do not see how anyone unless they have child size fingers can operate this machine.Super tare.Merge bestial cu Linux.Dar daca ai "norocul" sa uploadezi un firmware dubios e cam nasol.I have had 3 of these MP3 players.

El peso del equipo es adecuado y se puede trabsportar facilmente. En pocas palabras es un a buena compraeste peque?o aparatico nos salvo las vacaciones, no habia tiempo ni espacio para cargar y bajar nuestras fotos en un pc asi que solo con el ipod y este accesorio pudimos bajar mas de 3 mil fotos de nuestro viaje con total comodidad, es un poco lento pero sencillo practico y seguro. lo recomiendo 1000%!!!! ademas es muy economicoIf you don't have a stereo with an entrance for Ipod, this product will help you a lot, you won't use your CD's anymore.Acts more as a flashlight than an area illumination.

Ama bu ?r?n? g?r?nce ve ?zelliklerini ipodda elde etmek icin bir ipod parasi daha harcamak gerekirdi herhalde. Radyosu d?nyan?n her yerinde ?ekebilecek ?zellige sahip, kay?t yapabiliyor olmas? ?ok ?ok iyi bir ozellik bence. Video kaliteside cok cok basarili. Kullanimi da ipod kadar basit. Fakat menulerin ve opsiyonlarin biraz daha detaya ihtiyaci var. Birde urunun icinden cikan kulakliklar pek kaliteli degilThis did not work at all.  The company refuses to refund my money.  Buyer beware.  Don't buy this junk from this shady company.I had no problems.  It works just like it stated on the package.Este es mi segundo WRT54G, ahora "GL". No he revisado el firmware de linksys, ya que inmediatamente le puse Tomato, sin embargo es un router de muy larga tradici?n y personalmente nunca he tenido problemas con la marca Linksys. Estuve pensando si comprar este modelo o el nuevo "G2" o alguno de la nueva serie, pero si bien son m?s estilizados, no creo que ofrezcan la versatilidad de estos, sobre todo este modelo que es compatible con Linux y por medio de firmwares alternativos se puede sacar lo mejor de su hardware, como es el caso con Tomato u otros como dd-wrt, openwrt, etc. Lo utilizo conectado a un modem adsl en modo "bridge", as? que el router hace la negociaci?n PPPoE y adquiere directamente la ip p?blica, me ha resultado muy confiable, lo recomiendo.I gifted this to a friend and they love it, specially because it supports their back.Esto es para los de habla hispana. Este DVD Recorder es de batalla, trabaja muy bien, yo estoy viviendo en la ciudad de M?xico. Es muy flexible a la hora de editar video como por ejemplo acortando t?tulos, quitar comerciales de programas de TV, nombrar tus t?tulos. Excelente. El programar las grabaciones que quieras de tu TV es muy intuitivo y f?cil de usar. La grabaci?n a DVD no es complicada, ya que teniendo los t?tulos en el disco duro, puedes escoger de entre los que tengas y pasarlos al DVD. Lo que s? no pude hacer es ver este DVD en mi DVD de mi computadora, a?n tengo que ver por qu?, pero se me hace raro, porque los DVD players pueden tocar estos DVD sin ning?n problema. Gracias.El producto en general es interesante, pero tiene algunas desventajas en mi humilde opini?n - A menos que se tenga una muy prolija y excelente letra, la migraci?n de los textos a Word es deficiente - Es dificil de conseguir repuestos de los grafos localmente - El l?piz resulta un tanto grueso, espero en futuras evoluciones, puedan reducir el tama?o del mismo En general, aceptable y ?til.Compr? este reproductor hace un par de semanas basado en las revisones de otros usuarios. Antes ten?a un reprodutor Creative y este lo supera en un 100%. Todo lo que promete el fabricante se cumple. La duraci?n de la bater?a es de alrededor de 11 a 14 horas. El fabricante constantemente actualiza el firmware del equipo. Entre la cosas negativas que encuentro de este modelo esta el control con una especie de Joystick que es un poco complicado de usar al principio. Lo segundo negativo es la poca facilidad de pasar videos al formato exigido. A pesar de que el equipo viene con el software Jetaudio y permite el traspaso de video, esta operaci?n a mi no me ha resultado. Lo tercero es que no trae un estuche para guardarlo.. (se vende por separado) En conclusi?n, comparado con otras marcas es mucho mejor. Si tuviera que comprarlo de nuevo.... lo har?a.There's nothing to complain about the genuine ink cartridge. You could refill it with the refill ink, just do it before the genuine ink exhausts.I like the esy use of the phone...problem is when I call certain people there is an echo and it drives me crazy.

Other than that it has decent sound and holds a respectable number of songs.Excelente reproductor no solo en tama?o fisico sino de capacidad, muy solido , unicamente flaquea en momentos con los videos pero aparte de eso un excelente reproductor.I had a problem with my subscription when i activated my software, the email responses were insulting and condesding.

Lo recomiendo.The service was excelent, The time of delivery excelent, The support was excelent, The product excelent.This radio does not have weather alert despite the description claming otherwise and the battery backup only backs up the time... so if the power fails in a storm you're out of luck.Al fin encontr? un control remoto que realmente es universal, porque tiene una gran lista de dispositivos con sus c?digos, y si no estuviera en la lista, se puede programar, para que aprenda las funciones desde el control original. Funciona perfectamente en mi televisor Aiwa, para el que no encontraba control que le funcionara, este si. El unico defecto que le encuentro, es que el material parece un poco fr?gil y resbaladizo, se me cay? una vez y ahora tiene un ruido en el interior, como de una pieza quebrada. Totalmente Recomendado.Excelenteo producto. Gran empaque, trae como valor agregado el convertidor a SD Card. Tal como siempre se ha categorizado SanDisk "EXCELENTE PRODUCTO"Lots of bells and whistles. Does a fair job but is overpriced.My headphones broke after three weeks.

I once esteemed its silvery resplendence. This product now impresses me as nothing more than painted chattel to be abused by paupers and mendicants, to daub with their oily fingers.

This causes unintentional button clicks and possible data loss. I have contacted Adesso, and they replied that there is no way to disable this behaivior.

On 6/27/07, when I checked my "order status" Amazon.com indicated an estimated ship date of 8/26 - 8/29. If the item wasn't readily available, Amazon.com should inform the customer Prior to order placement.pros: charges ipod, can tune ipod into any station(no need to search for a static channel like most FM Transmitters) cons:there is some static in the background when you turn up the volume in your car, the cradle is a bit flimsyIf you look at the "Product Details" section above it says "Product Dimensions: 9 x 2 x 7 inches ; 1 pounds ".

I am repeating this review for the same players with different memory sizes, hopefully to help some poor person that buys this thing.This product was everything it was advertised to be.The details says it has DVI, theres no DVI.

Fortunately I can return it unopened so I'm only out the time and hassle.Though this item was invoiced at the time of purchase; as of today, I have not received it and it has not been sent to me.

Some times I can feel the vibrations of the DVD while holding the camcorder.my two boys received one for christmas this year and they have no complaints!! cant ask for more than that. they use them all the timeAs a business traveler, I can take this with me. If I chose the in-dash navigation option, not only would it cost nearly $2000, but I couldn't take it with me and use it in rental cars when I travel. The only negative is that you need to spring for an updated map every 2 years to the tune of $60...bummer!Works alright, but the menu system very confusing and difficult to use.Hi, I have had this camera for a week and it totally rocks. [...] Thank you! p.s. this camera is smoking HOTThis router works fine. The reason I didn't give it five stars is that it did not provide configuration software for mac users.Finds hot spots and identifies them. Does what it says. PERIOD!Product description for this antenna led me to believe that my wireless signal would be stronger and farther. This antenna did not improve my wireless signal.Very sturdy mount for my 60" Pioneer plasma.

This happened spontaneously while my computer was dead, so I don't have a backup. I didn't abuse it, and it was under normal conditions in my pocket, and now I'm very unsatisfied. BUY A FREAKING SANDISK!!!For the price, this is a nice MP3 player for music.  However, I was very disappointed to find that it has no ability to bookmark audio files I download from my public library.  The service people say it can only bookmark *.aa (Audible)files.This program does not allow you to copy any encrypted movies(means all the movies out there).   Although it says 'you can copy any movies' on the box, you will find out the inability after installing the program.      ......you can copy movies to any format to your Pocket PC, PSP, Palm......   NOT TRUE. This software is totally useless.I'm disappointed with this TV. The only way to see the entire picture from a 16:9 HD source is in the 4:3 mode, which compresses the 16:9 picture from the sides to fill the 4:3 screen. There is no option for a letterbox picture (so people don't look ridiculously fat or skinny). I called Magnavox and they confirmed that this is the correct functioning of the television. Not exactly HD, then, is it?I use a MAC and the product description says that it is compatible with MAC but the fact is it works only with windows so if your a MAC user spend your money on another productThis unit has all the bells and whistles.  Very pleased with the accuracy.  Just needs a more detailed preloaded base mapUnlocking the power of the WRT54G is an absolute blast. Once you have your custom FOSS firmware on these babies you can make them do wonderful things!Have been dealing with other Wall Arms for my other LCD's. This one was deffinately properly designed. From ease of hanging the LCD on the premounted plate to the a conduit that hides allt he cables. A+ productThis replaces an over-the waste basket shredder which had constant problems.  This one is worry free.  It doesn't whine.  You can carry a conversation (in person, not over the phone), while shredding.  A thing of beauty is a joy forever, so is a shredder that isn't loud and works.Bought this card for use in a Windows XP Pro 64 bit machine. Everything installs with out any errors. But the device shows up without a driver in the hardware list.This 3.5 Millimeter to stereo RCA cable is a most if you like to listen to music at home. Just hook it up to your home stereo and you have an instant juke box from your MP3 player.The tracks have a tic that repeats every second, i.e. all voice recordings have a tic tic tic tic in the background.This is a wonderful and inexpensive bit of software!   Although, I am not into comics I love the templates for my photography.  There are all kinds of possibilities.  Do have a go at it.THE DISPLAY GOES BLANK AFTER 3 MONTHS OF USE, SAVE YOUR RECEIPTS YOU WILL NEED IT, TO RETURN THIS LEMMON.THis is an excellant machine. I only have one thing to add over the detailed reviews provided earlier... The TV Guide feature does work without a cable box.Okay, I don't  have this mp3 player, but just think about it. It holds maybe fifteen songs. A 512mb iPod shuffle holds 120 songs, so if you divide 512 by 8 you get 64 and if you divide 120 by 8 you get fifteen! It's almost funny... fifteen songsvery please with this product.  Love to use it at home and in the car.The item works, but the streaming video is jerky and rather fuzzy. The sound is the same.When you try to attach it to the car does not fit properly and in any curve or speed change the ipod goes to the floor of the car.I was very disappointed to discover that my 8125's keyboard won't slide out with this cover in place.  Not terribly useful, is it?Just a warning to others like myself who own the Canon MP520 All-In-One printer, scanner, etc.  Under the product description, it states that the CL1-8 4-color multipack will work with this printer.  The three color tanks, blue, magenta, and yellow,(#8) will work, but the black cartridge will not.  The black refill cartridge for the MP520 does not take the number #8, but the number #5 replacement. Therefore, I gave this item three stars for the three usable ink carts.  Just beware of the mis-information listed on Amazon through Canon.This shredder jams repeatedly. It's the second Fellows shredder that I have had over the years and they both jammed a lot.BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE TINKERBELL. THIS WAS A CUTE AND INEXPENSIVE ADDITION TO OUR GROWING COLLECTIONI can't beleive these reviews at all after I experience the product & service. They sent a defective item, impossible to get in touch with customer service (only voice message without no return call). I am reserching how to refund. My friend inform me same experience.Reviewer: Mister Quickly "Amazon epicurean" (Victoria, BC Canada) While I was initially attracted to this product for the sterling glamour of its silvery surface, this soon tarnished once I began operating its more than yielding button interface.

Finale SongWriter does that.  The lyrics find their way to the correct note.  The Midi connection works and all the parts of a composition is enveloped in this software. One of the attractions for me is the cost.  Finale SongWriter does not extract your final dollar from your stash.  Try this program, and you will find many facets hidden that makes Finale SongWriter a positive!Our family has two and you can not go wrong and the price is rightfirmware problems with update software that's more difficult than average to apply should not occur in an item this simpleIt's fantastic!

I love the characters and find it to be another example of his wonderful style.this camera is not wireless you have to hook it up to your router or computer just like a webcam the only difference is the other computers can see this one but I was thinking you could mount the camera with no wires we have a security camera at work with no wires  and through your router see pictures glad it was just $100Does what it is supposed to do the way it is supposed to do it.

The anchors were about 4 inches too short for our Queen sized bed.this product is worthless for music.  for voice, it's alright.  and yes, i did turn the volume all the way up on the mp3 player.Not sure what happened.  I was watching a dvd, paused it, and when I resumed play it hung the PC.  On reboot, the DRU-800a would not recognize any media.This product that SanDisk markets is not compatible with Mac computers. The manufactor does not disclose the fact it is not compatible with a Mac computer, until you call for tech support at SanDisk. When asked how to resolve the problem is to return it or sell it to someone else. SanDisk is not accountable for the error and dismisses the customer to resolve their error. I give this product a ZERO because of the lack of integrity by the company.I now have the workout of my dreams.  I love to walk and explore.

This product will pay for itself over a short period of time.If you like Tim Burton, you will undoubtedly be entertained by this movie. The animated charactors are done so life-like that you'll get absorbed into the story, that you'll forget they are animated charactors and view them as real people. Another quality job for both director and actors.Excellent, and reasonably priced via Amazon. It might be difficult to program but the tech line will solve it and it's done. All these remotes are trainable and when a problem occurs, you click on "Help" and it asks questions, then carries out changes, and asks whether that fixed the problem, until it does. Fascinating.To connect female HDMI port to female DVI port (computer video output to TV input)To connect female HDMI port to female DVI port (computer video output to TV input)Lots of space. Loads and writes fast. And yes YOU CAN MAKE A PANDORA'S MAGIC MEMORYSTICK OUT OF THIS, if you don't know what that is it's the memorystick you use with a Pandora's battery to hack a PSP.Remote has out performed remote that cost alot more, it has repleced four remotes in one room and three in anotherThis product is awesome.  Since I installed it there have been NO sperious advertisements PeriodDirections while on surface streets are decent.  Once on freeways (I live in Los Angeles therefore there are a lot of freeways and overpasses) it can give faulty directions. Overall for somebody with direction dyslexia, it's a life saver.I'm just an average picture taker. I don't know any of the technical jargon that people speak, but I do know I love this Card to death, it enhanced the quality of the pictures I take and it increased the number of pictures I can take.  I think it's outstanding for the novice photographer.Compro los productos Corsair porque se que son marcas que cuidan su calidad. Mi memoria USB reci?n adquirida funciona a la perfecci?n, incluye un cable colgante para colgarlo en mi cuello, muy buena adicci?n.The shredder is advertised with the ability to shred credit cards. I tried to shred one and it jammed the shredder. I had to use tweezers to pry the card out. This shredder can only handle up to four sheets of paper and no credit cards.This unit has all the basic features, voice prompt, user favorites, extnsive database, at an affordable pricecan now watch tv on my 3 lcd screens resolution 3840 * 1024 desktop. can now watch tv on my tablet anywhere in house with wireless home net, flawless viewing experience with my pre-n wireless router.Night Shot and Ir Light was as advertised.  Video light and Night Shot gives you two lighting sources in one. It Has an Infra Red light which covers about 5 times more area than just the camcorder itself and an ordinary light which takes away shadows from close up face shots. It offers Sony quality at a reasonable price.This appears to be the same system Wal-Mart is currently selling for $394 (as of April 2006).  It's a decent system, but like all the other Sony home theatre systems, the CD/DVD player is painfully s-l-o-w!  Maybe Sony will fix this issue in next year's models?This Heart Rate Monitor is slim, unobtrusive, and essential to maintaining effective and safe heart rates while exercising. I wouldn't be without it.Does not work as advertised. Customer support just says it is your PC's problem, or that the material is copy protected, which is was not. Major problems converting DVD's to PDA formats such a WMV. Copied DVD's do not work on most home DVD players.It looks kind of cheap when you take it out of the box, but other than that, the mp3 player is ok.Yes, a nightmare, you dream about, start and restart, install and uninstall for this abominable excuse for a piece of programmed software. Error messages, just a sample, LU1812, LU1803, LU1814, 9999.71, and the DELETE from their internet site, impossible..all their site requests relate to actions that just cannot be activated, remedial suggestions are not workable. It is, by far the winner of the Golden Fish Bone award for the STRESS ACTIVATOR 2006. Amazons review wont accept a zero rating.With any FM transmitter, you must turn the volume up on your iPod to max you can without distortion to drown out background stations.  Regulate volume with the car stereo, not the iPod, which should be at max vol possible without distortion.OK for a gag gift and a few minutes of entertainment, but not if you paid more than $2 for them. I paid $12. Not worth it.This garbage, like everything else offered by TigerDirect didn't work for Sata. It died after a week or so.The PC system requirements did not address the compatibility with MAC OSX but I connected the player to my IMAC, ignored loading the supplied CD, and dragged music from ITUNES without any problem.When installed CD, it can not be recognized by my lap top. So, I could not install it. Dump....I am against spanking, but if there's anyone who deserves to be spanked it's Dobson! For writing all those slick, UN-scientific, cruel and stupid books about beating children with belts, wooden boards, and whips. If Dobson was beaten the way he recommends children be beaten, maybe he'd actually wake up to the fact that his methods are inhumane, humiliating and dangerous. On the other hand, I strongly suspect Dobson has a spanking fetish, since he speaks so fondly of being whipped with his mother's fancy girdle. He'd probably enjoy a spanking, the guy is sick and a disgrace to Christianity.This stand leaves the front center of the television unsupported. This has caused my Samsung HLR5667 to bow at the speaker bar after only a few months. If it continues to sag it could possibly cause damage to the internal components. You will have to put a wood or metal piece between the TV and the stand to support it which kills the looks of the stand TV combo.for a couple of hundreds of dollar more it worth protecting your Home Theatre System.  It provides clean power to your Home Theatre System.Huey is a basic colorimeter, opt for the Pro upgrade for software and multiple monitor support.Don't waste your money on this one.  You can't use it without other FM stations bleeding thru.i would rate this item -10. your page does not indicate that there would be a charge of the $20 for the analysis of the exposed kit.amazon would not give me the phone no. of the company - only an email address-which was invalid. it seems to me that amazon is responsible for any item it advertises on its web page.how about a refund? S. F. KudzinI've had no problems with this card - it does seem very slow in the device I have it in but it could be it's the device that's slow rather than the card....  anyway, it's doing the job.  no frills....The usual performance as a TV but doesn't have a vga port for pc input so you can't use this as a monitor without a converter.  Buy the LCD version instead.The usual performance as a TV but doesn't have a vga port for pc input so you can't use this as a monitor without a converter.

But sometimes you want just a plain espresso too.Very exquisite, powerful, the only issue is battery lifeThis is exactly what I need - nothing too fancy but a player that gives me what I need - ability to listen to my music, FM player when I don't want to listen to my music and the ability to record notes if I am in a meeting.The box clearly says "not compatible with 40G or 60G iPod".Product does work as advertised. The only problem is that when I received it the threads were missing on one of the cable connectors. How can this happen? Isn't the product tested before it goes out the door? There is no excuse for poor quality.we have these in those hard to see parts of the cupboard. One tap it is on and another it is off. LEDs are the way of the future.we have these in those hard to see parts of the cupboard. One tap it is on and another it is off.

I enjoy the portability and the voice directions are perfect.Outputs from HP 1022 will not match outputs from HP printers that support PCL 6. Applications that depend on precise print formatting will probably fail.This divice freeses every now and then, it's not worth returning so i will just deal with it.We have had the t.v. for 20 months when these rectangular shaped, multicolored boxes apearred across the screen. They measured around 3/4 by 1/2 inch and have rapidly changing colors in them.  I have been reading alot of posts and it looks like this is a very common problem occuring after 18-20 months of ownership.  The cost to fix the problem is 800.00 for parts and 500 give or take for the tech.  Until Sony resolves this issue I would avoid the T.V.My book's firewire port was recognized by a cardbus adapter (I-O gear), but a firewire express card (Startech-2 port ) did not recognize the drive. Any suggestions?It might be a bit more expensive than other music players, but when it comes to managing all your stuff and being to find that 1 particular song in the 30 gb. of songs you can have, the iPod pays off immediately.I like the forerunner because of the price and the functions. My only complaint is that it is sometimes cumbersome when I wear it on my wrist.If you want to use a universal remote with STR-DE598, you will have to switch the receiver from AV2 to AV1 mode. To toggle modes, press Power button while holding "Enter" on the receiver. The remote that comes with the receiver only works in AV2 mode. I suggest you configure all settings with the original remote, then switch to AV1 to use a universal one with limited functionality.Ok, i own one of this... and since i am currently on a budget, i decided to buy it refurbished!  I feel like the money that i paid for it was a waste!  because it will play some songs, but then it will stop, and say that it cannot open a file (which it has played before), and stop playing... Then when i click on the play button, and choose between artist, song, and all that...  the only option will be the name of the song that it was about to play when it stopped.... so i have to turn it off, and turn it back on... it happens very often!  So... don't buy it refurbished!!!!!!I was very disappointed, did not fit the 42" Sylvania 8" short. Stuck with something I cannot useVery dissapointing.  The inexpensive foam of the ball just disintigrates in certain rims.The bag was not what I was expecting, and, furthermore, the retailer SUCKS in terms of their return policy.Won't work with my car's factory-installed cassette player. So sad ... My recommendation is, spend a bit more on quality machinery.Vendor claims Amazon puts up the title and they match the product, so if Amazon sells "Brakes", only after the item arrives at your doorstep, will you read from the invoice that it was brakes for a Mercedes and not your BMW!!! The item is shipped as a HD15M, RCA-F/DIN4-F MATROX G450/  on the invoice ... If you don't have a Matrox G450, you are on the hook for your shipping charges back to them.Our baby girl practically lives in this. You can leave it open when it is hot, or pull and zip it up when it is cold. It is so soft inside. She loves it.Garmin has the MSRP for this exact model listed as $399.99 on their website. That is only around an $80 savings. Amazon needs to update their list price on this item.This CD should be priced at $5.00. The graphics will not keep your child's attention and it's pretty lame. It was a wasted purchase, I have to bribe my child to use it, because it so boring.This CD should be priced at $5.00. The graphics will not keep your child's attention and it's pretty lame.

(This is annoying because I need to play in sync with DVD movies.) Is it only my device, or are yours like that too???My only problem is that it plays about 1 second per minute slower than the playing time on the display, no matter whether mp3 or atrac format. (This is annoying because I need to play in sync with DVD movies.) Is it only my device, or are yours like that too???The material is soft and warm, and very roomy. The delivery was on time. No complaints.If you organize your files into folders and subfolders in Windows and then drag and drop them to the Sansa player you may be disappointed when you go to play them: they may be listed as one big mass of files - no folders / subfolders. This will save you a lot of aggravation: The problem is that ID3 tags on the files must all be uniform. Put files in folders on your pc how you want them, then open the files in winamp and select 'View file info' - under Album type in the name you want like "Album A" - do this for the id3v1 and id3v2 tags and hit Update. Do this with each song. All songs you want under album A must have an "album A" tag, B must all have "b" tags, etc. Now when you want to play by "folders" on the Sansa player hit the Menu button  - select Play Music - then Album. There they are!This cable doesn't work for connecting a Mac G4 (version 10.4.11) to an Epson Stylus Photo EX.This calculator is limited to a very basic set of functions. It has 12 modes, each of which lets you calculate a limited number of variables after the input of another set of variables. The Amortization mode, for example, permits the calculation of only 5 variables: the remaining balance after payment x, the interest portion of payment x, the principle portion of payment x, and the interest and principle paid between payments x and y. Each of these variables requires input of the  monthly payment. Stupidly, the calculator does not allow you to calculate the monthly payment itself (based on loan amount, term, and interest rate), and will not you let you calculate any of the other 5 variables without inputting the monthly payment amount first. This makes the calculator useless for most mortgage calculations.Worthless.  Half the time it doesn't work -- picks up other monitors, or doubles your heart rate, or doesn't show one, or shows a ridiculously low one.  Nice, when it works, but completely unreliable.  Don't waste your money.It's a tale of the living & the dead coming together in holy matromony in Tim Burton's "Corpse Bride" In the gothic era of the 19th century in Europe a young man named Victor Van Dort inadvertally reserects a young woman while practing his vows & asumes he is her husband. It's a brilliant comical & romantic vision of the undead & the living, pure genius this film is. Featuring the voice talents of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gough & Christopher Lee.

How exciting can this review be.The description of the product was deceiving.  The photo showed a router and 2 handsets.  The description talked about the router and both handsets.  All I received was 1 handset.These folks continue to amaze me with their advancement of the state of the art in memory, and Amazon purchase and delivery is so dependable it's like money in the bank.  I hope no one comes in and tries to "improve" things.I evaluated MP3 players for a while - and at $45 this Sansa M240 player was a steal!  The iPod certainly has its advantages (and a ton of marketing!), but here are the top 5 reasons why I prefer this MP3 player: 1)  FM Stereo - can program upto 20 channels - iPod does not! 2)  Rip songs from any CD 3)  Load songs in about ANY format (MP3, WMA, etc) 4)  Buy/download songs from FREE from any MP3 website (iTunes??) 5)  AAA battery - can buy it anywhere - no need for special charger! 6)  Portable - I can play this in the car with a CD adapter - the iPod needs a special contraption ($$$) to play in the car stereo.... okay, so maybe 6 reasons.......If you feel like the 3 dollars in your wallet should be punished, burn it. Do not waste your time on this product.  It does not work.  At least if you chewed your money your stomach would be full.When I saw this, I was very excited.  However, since my pad is raised on four sides, rather than two, it did not fit properly and I have to return it.  What a bummer!  I can't find a change pad cover that will fit my pad, so I guess I will have to go without.very dissapointed customer 1 order for 20 bottles of the above and only 6 recieved,another order of 30 ordered and none delivered& not just the beauteous title character, -Corpse Bride- is a dark 1940's-Disney-style story about a nervous groom whose arranged marriage - which  seems destined to be joyful, regardless - is put off when he fumbles his vows [for 3 hours!].  He runs off to practicce & ends up wed to the Corpse Bride ... & then the fun begins.  Musical numbers, creepy skeletons, maggot jokes [*not* what you think!] & the course of cursed True Love abound in this delightful, black-chocolate confection. Enjoy!This thing is slick.  Was nervous with just 2 screws holding to wall; but is very sturdy.William J. Macdermott, you are wrong. The Panasonic KX-TG5433M is availble at very common brick and mortar stores like Target and WalMart.Amazon WON'T ship this item to military stationed in Iraq. Piss poor support. Thanks a lot Amazon. I'll shop elsewhere from now on!these will not work in a dvd recorder to record tv.  it didn't say on the webpage, but on the back of the discs it states that the discs support recording only at 4x and 8x.  my dvd-recorder supports dvd+rw media but to record television 1x recording must be supported.I've had this model (HOLMES branded -- I don't know what this Jarden brand is) for two years and it works flawlessly.  Tank is solid and has not broken or cracked.  Turns on and off automatically according to the level I have set with no issues. Keep in mind there are two types of humidifiers: those that use a wick to blow moist air into the room, but do not show a visible mist (this model is that type) and those that blow a visible mist in the air via the ultrasonic method.  Just because you do not see a visible mist with this unit does not mean it's not working.  I have a hygrometer in the room which clearly verifies what I feel -- this unit works. I recommend it.Ordered this at the same time as ordering a Cobra XRS 9340. I'm VERY pleased with the design & function of this device. As i see it it's a must have since the original suction cups that come with most laser/radar warners are crap.This is a solid basic heart rate monitor that functions as advertised. It is adequate for anyone other than world class athletes that need more bells and whistles.Thanks for the timely service.   And the Flash Drive is perfect for my needsYou can not program this piece of junk to alarm on just one particlar day of the week.It will alarm everyday,weekends,or mon-fri.If you wanted  it to alarm on just monday,you cant do it.An other product from Chine that has an user guide the is useless.Oh my!  This item exceeded my expectations.  I have a T-1 (neighborhood shared) at home and DSL at the office, so it is like watching DirectTV on my TV at my office.

If your computer uses -5 volts, you can have a failure.  If your present power supply provides -5 volts, you probably should check out compatibility.i'm on my second wick filter at this point and have no problems with them. they do discolor a bit in my humidifier at the top end (turns to a brown color) but there is no smell or visible mildew, so it must just be some minerals in the tap water that collect at the top end of the filter where the water evaporates. I am pleased with the performance and longevity of this productNow that my son is mobile, I had to move all my home theater components into a closed cabinet. Anyone who has a PS3 will tell you that the thing throws off a LOT of heat. Connecting these fans to the USB ports did the trick. Having the fans draw hot air out, lowers the inside temp considerably. One minor "Con" is that they can be a bit noisy when the speed is at max. Adjusting them to approx 80% makes them barley noticeable while a movie is paused and unnoticeable while the movie/ game is playing.This device does not work with my 2004 Toyota Corolla. Apparently, there's something funky with the power receptacles in my Toyota, because this device works with my other car. I've tried both sockets in the Toyota, and neither work, which is bizarre, because my cell phone adapters work fine with the Toyota's receptacles. Anyway, I contacted Coby's customer support for a resolution to this problem, but it's been over a week, and they have yet to respond.the lide 25 scanner by canon will scan documents to pdf format, tiff file jpeg, photo shop and will allow you to do other things that im learning to do as I use it more and more each day.The Anti-virus portion is fine.  The rest of it...in a nutshell: glitchy with terrible, confusing support.  I am not a novice with a computer.  If you need clarification of internet live support, you can pay for the honor of calling and speaking to a person.  I am operating without half of the Suite because of this. I will not purchase/renew the suite again.Unless you own a battery factory, and can replace the 4 aaa batteries every week, don't bother.This is a quality case but it if you plan on carrying hand free you'll need a belt cause there's no clip.  It's of no use if you have shorts or warm ups.NAV 2005 on my machines had the annoying "must activate" every few days, so I upgraded to NAV 2006.  During install, NAV claims you must uninstall ZoneAlarm. So I did.  But I'm annoyed at the lack of advance warning for that, and the nagging feeling that this is a ploy to upself to the Norton firewall.  However, NAV did not destroy my machine, and the performance doesn't seem all that bad.  YMMV.This tv has been dissapointing for us.  Shortly after installing picture started flashing, flickering & rolling for no apparent reason.  We troubleshooted thinking it might be other equipment affecting the picture but realize now that it's a defective tv.  I cringe at the prospect of dealing with customer service centers, tv repairmen & warranty limitations.This detector, and any other product from this manufacturer are very basic detectors with no scrambling capabilities whatsoever.  They are frauds.  Numerous independent research companies have determined that no added technology aside from detection technology exists within the casing of any of this company's products.  Stay clear.This program claims that it works on Mac OS X, but it does not.  The company has not responded to our messages, so do not expect tech support if you have problems.  We researched the product & system requirements carefully before ordering and are disappointed that we have no idea how the program actually is.  Beware of false advertising by JumpStart.With the price of the unit being lower than a year ago. It has become a valuable tool and lives up to the hype.This is a huge waste of money... very boring... entertained my daughter for about two minutes...This antenna is so lightweight that the base can't hold it. When the "rabbit ears" are extended the whole thing can topple over. I was very disappointed.The transmitter works, but you cannot hear the music through your computer's speakers at the same time. Quite disappointing, I like having my music playing from both my computer room and my stereo system in the rest of the house.I don't know how this happened, to be fair, but amazon shipped me this ink that's totally incompatible with the printer.The Forerunner is packed with info derived by the GPS.  Your speed, elevation, incline, etc.  Very pleased witht the item.It is clearly a stab at showing the contrast between Calvinism and Arminianisn concerning the doctrine of predestination. Too bad they could not spell ARMINIAN correctly!I have this in my toyota corolla, and it sucks but my other car where the antenna is on side works perfect. So i guess it depends on what car you have.I was a big fan of version 5 so I upgraded to version 6 without hesitation.  Unfortuantely some of the "optimization" tools do anything but optimize your computer.  In my case it appears to have disabled crucial software start-ups and deleted important registry entries.  And although the manufacturer claims that these changes can be undone, they cannot.This product has met our expectations.  We were hesitant to purchase a portable unit but this seems to do all that we need.Prompt service.  This was a xmas gift and the recipient was delighted.  I have a Garmin myself and would be lost (literally) without it.The item was shipped promptly, although the clip art was terrible.The item was shipped promptly, although the clip art was terrible.BEWARE this cable is not a universal fit.

But when received and opened, the parallel connector is not compatible with my HP LaserJet 1100A.  Wasted money.This player is fragile and unreliable.  Do not buy it.

I apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you for choosing Canon. ------------------- The MP780 does have 64-bit drivers available, however, so that might be a worthy alternative for you early adopters, but I am not very impressed with Canon's commitment to buyers of their products. Just a heads-up.Yeah, this thing is junk. I was scoring "Freebird" as a banjo piece with cello accents highlighted in the background and the banjo sound reproduction was terrible, the dotted half notes were in sequence with the 3/8ths and 5/16ths....and don't get me started on how the treble cleff was out of allignment causing my measures (and eventually verses) to slide in to one another. I gave this program 1 star because it didn't give me the option of putting a barfing face for a rating. Yeah, this thing is junk.- can't use it play 80% of the mp3 files on my hard disk. - its a real pain to get any file on to the device - no support whatsoever for unicode file names now i use it mainly as a storage device. mp3 player? forget it. sony has completely ruined its reputation.DVD and CD storage is very personal.  If you like this style, it works.Works just fine.  By the way, Brian Morris of Pittsburgh isn't too bright, is he?I recieved the transmitter and it didn't work and when I called the tech support they were not helpful either.I have been trying for hours to get this horrible program (Virus) off my brother's computer. This thing does not work but is impossible to uninstall. Don't do it!I sent it back.  It's just something else to clutter my desk. I have a 3/1 printer that scans just fine!Specifications Standards * 802.11g * 802.11b * INMPR Compliant * TCP/IP * UPnP AV 1.0 * USB 2.0 Media Streaming Protocol * HTTP Network * 802.11g Wireless * 802.11b Wireless * Wired LAN: 10/100Mbps Ethernet * DHCP or Static IP Address Wireless Security * WPA-PSK Encryption * Hardware-based WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) * Up to 128-bit Encryption Antenna * Type: 2.4 GHz Swivel-Type * Frequency: 2.4G to 2.5 GHz * Impedance: 50 Ohms * Gain: 2 dBi Supported Audio Formats * MP3 * WMA * AIFF * WAV * Ogg Vorbis Supported Image Formats * JPEG * BMP * PNG * TIFF * JPEG2000 * GIF Supported Video Formats * WMV9 * MPEG 1 * MPEG 2 * MPEG 4 * Xvid * AVI (MPEG-4 Layer Only) Audio Playlist Formats * M3U * PLS Supported Subtitle Format * SRT Outputs * HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) * Component Video * Coax Digital Audio * Optical Digital Audio * Composite Audio and Video * S-Video Power * Power Source: 110-120V, 0.5A * Power Consumption: 10W Temperature * Operating: 0?C to 45?C * Storage: -25?C to 55?C Humidity * 10% to 95% (Non-Condensing) Certifications * FCC * CSA * CE Dimensions * L = 16.75 inches * W = 11.25 inches * H = 1.5 inches Weight * 5.5 lbs Warranty * 1 YearSpecifications Standards * 802.11g * 802.11b * INMPR Compliant * TCP/IP * UPnP AV 1.0 * USB 2.0 Media Streaming Protocol * HTTP Network * 802.11g Wireless * 802.11b Wireless * Wired LAN: 10/100Mbps Ethernet * DHCP or Static IP Address Wireless Security * WPA-PSK Encryption * Hardware-based WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) * Up to 128-bit Encryption Antenna * Type: 2.4 GHz Swivel-Type * Frequency: 2.4G to 2.5 GHz * Impedance: 50 Ohms * Gain: 2 dBi Supported Audio Formats * MP3 * WMA * AIFF * WAV * Ogg Vorbis Supported Image Formats * JPEG * BMP * PNG * TIFF * JPEG2000 * GIF Supported Video Formats * WMV9 * MPEG 1 * MPEG 2 * MPEG 4 * Xvid * AVI (MPEG-4 Layer Only) Audio Playlist Formats * M3U * PLS Supported Subtitle Format * SRT Outputs * HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) * Component Video * Coax Digital Audio * Optical Digital Audio * Composite Audio and Video * S-Video Power * Power Source: 110-120V, 0.5A * Power Consumption: 10W Temperature * Operating: 0?C to 45?C * Storage: -25?C to 55?C Humidity * 10% to 95% (Non-Condensing) Certifications * FCC * CSA * CE Dimensions * L = 16.75 inches * W = 11.25 inches * H = 1.5 inches Weight * 5.5 lbs Warranty * 1 Yearthis item is just what doc ordered I get my channels as clear as a bell the super bowl was perpect thank youI purchase this product. The memory card works in my phone, however the adaptor that comes with it was defective, therefore i cannot use it in my computer or any card reader. I called eek tech but they would not replace it. I paid about $4 in shipping for a $1 product. I will dispute the charges with mastercard and rate this product from this store to Zero.This bouncer has all the bells and whistles you can ask for, however it requires an excessive amount of time to assemble. Unfortunately, the screws require a lot of manipulation in order to securely fasten in to the holes.  Furthermore, some of the screws do not fully enter the hole which is another drawback. The assembly of this product should be seamless and require minimal effort.  For the amount of time required to assemble, I would not have purchased this item if I would have known in advance. Please develop products that require minimal effort and time to assemble.  There has to be a easier and more efficient method to assemble a bouncer.I agree with the comment below.  I was under the assumption as the previous reviewer.  I would pay about $5 with no shipping but no more.  It basically is more cosmetic than productive.this is a very effecient way to save a lot of documents and not having to worry about installing another software for this USB flash drive. I certainly recommend this to any student or person who needs to store data.If you have more than one pda, palm, pocket pc or smartphone and travelplans limits the number of items you want to bring along, forget the idea that you can just use your bought tomtom software on any of those pda's at random. Nope, TomTom only allows you to use the software on the pda you activate it on. Customer support insinuated that otherwise the customer would only start to give illegal copies to all their friends and family. "that's not how we can do business", the only alternative is/was to buy separate software packages for each pda you use or plan to use. Smart thinking for a company who seems to like to insult the intellect of their buying public. Avoid this product until they figure out how to support buyers who pay legally for their software license.I've had this for a month or so, and it continually becomes what the Sandisc tech calls "corrupted." It plays through my library of books on tape and then refuses to play them again until I reformat it. And reload my Audible library. So far, no satisfaction from the manufacturer.This is an okay mouse.  But here are the problems: 1) The email and im buttons only work with a few software products.  I use Thunderbird and the email button doesn't work. 2) I've had the mouse for 4 months and am already on my third set of batteries!  This mouse does not save you battery power. 3) It's become very 'figity' lately - jumping around on the screen sometimes and very sensitive to double clicks. 4) The SetPoint software from Logitech is buggy.  Each time I start my PC it tells me that I need to reinstall SetPoint (which I have no to no avail).This watch worked only sporadically for me, and not at all if my wrist was moist from sweat.  All it did was make me frustrated.  Don't waste your money.I managed to sync with WMP ONCE before neither my laptop or desktop would recognize the device.  I spent hours trying to fix the problem until the e260 suddenly and completely died.  I sent it to Sansa but I don't expect any help . . .Died after a couple of days of use. Seller offered 7 day garuntee but has not respond to email for replacement or refund. I thought only SanDisk thumb drive died like this.I had no problems with this Ipod charger.  It charges rapidly and quickly and it doesn't over charge.  I carry it will me everywhere.99$? I found this same item on Radio Shack for 13$ The SAME EXACT ITEM! All it is is an LCD screen that receives radio signals that are transferred into icons. It is updated every 15 minutes and finds your location. Very neat item - for 13$ 99$ would be another story.this webcam is not compatible with acer ferrari, with windows xp. I don't know why. I just returned it.I have only had this unit for 1.5 years. Intermittently, there has been a strange error message (Download Connected/Download Standby), which Canon support says indicates a problem inside the printer that needs to be serviced. I have managed to get the problem fixed to date by unplugging and replugging the power cord, but it is unpredictable as to when it will be fixed. Could be minutes, could be hours. It has happened to me again recently, and this might be the final hour of its existence!! The cost of repair will probably be more than I paid for the unit. I have multiple HP units that have lasted years without problems. Back to HP for me!!!I recieved the product broken. It is of very poor quality. I request a return and a refund. Amazon was quick to comply.This is just about the perfect graphic design program for the non-professional or the professional who needs help occasionally.  It provides the tools and a few templates just in case but lets you do the design work all the way.  It is like a streamlined version of MS Publisher.  Love it.It is very convinient thing. It has an excelent security system for notebook, so you shouldn't worry about everyday carry of you laptop.This one does what it says it is supposed to do.  I throw my tivo across town to a second residence where I have a media center pc and lcd screen.  It is perfect.  I only need cable at one resdience.  I can stream it from one to the other; absolutely wonderful.  This lived up to its hype.In it's capacity as a USB hub the GUH420 appears to work as advertised and has 4 useable USB ports.  In it's capacity as a firewire hub, it lacks bus power and only has 2 usable ports for consumer devices.  The absence of bus power means the iSight does not work at all when connected through the hub and an iPod works until it's battery runs flat.I use this microwave for heating liquids. Occasionally I will use it to heat some food.  So my 5 stars is based on the fact that it is user friendly and meets my very basic requirements.I was very please with the quick delivery and attention I received. These ink tanks are a pain in the neck to track down, no store sells them. Thanks for stocking them and for the price.PaulaMediocre tire gauge that quit working after 1 year.  Replaced the batteries to no effect.  Will attempt to return it to this company, but from other posts, it looks like nothing will happen as they seem unresponsive.We didn't realize until we purchased the mount that not only does it hang on the wall but can move forward and be turned to both sidesWorks as advertised. Understanding the 1/2 sec or so delay, you can just hold the button and walk around to triangulate. But, of course if in an area with multiple signals it's hard to know what is where.I bought this card for my brother, he has a Nokia 6230i that according to Nokia the phone's memory card limit was 512 Mb, nevertheless this card worked fine.  No problems at all.This is an amazing keyboard for the money.  Tone is exceptionally beautiful and there are lots of bells and whistles.  Only one drawback is the readability of the display box.I love my BUSlink 256. The only problem is you cannot arrange your songs in the order you want them to play. It plays the albums in alphabetical order, and plays the songs in the order they appear on the albumI works as advertised.  It knows the street names and the gal doesn't get mad when I don't follow her instructions precisely.  My only disappointment is that you are limited to one waypoint.  My previous i-Way allowed any number of waypoints which was very desirable for my meals-on-wheels deliveries.  Finds itself quickly.You Should note that Intuit will not support this version after April 2009. Otherwise works fine if you don't need any Internet support.This product works as advertised. It's fully adjustable and lets you seek to any unused frequency.Our Nuvi has become our instant friend. We enjoy its knowledge and intellect and particularly its ability to be so patient with us when we make mistakes!Thought I was buying a waller with four CDs / DVD slots on each visible page, but this one only has two.  Hard to tell from the description/picture.mcaffee offers these rebates but refuses to honor them and you can see that this is a known issueI did have to tighten up the screws that hold the fan assy together to get rid of an annoying buzzing noise. Other than that I like it. I think the complaints about having to hold the tanks while filling because the top is not flat are blown out of proportion.My wife uses her flash drive for work and it saves her a lot of hastle when she can't remote into her work computer.It seems it has a firmware bug that causes a lockup when a file is corrupted, which can happen when you disconnect the player and a file is not completely written (No indication is given when the file writing is complete). This sort of problem would have come out in the most rudimentary testing, which says to me that they don't test their products at all and rely on the consumer to do their product testing. I for one will not be purchasing any more Sansa products, and I recommend that you don't either. If you do buy it, firmware upgrades won't help once the lockup occurs, so update it immediately when the stinking thing arrives.Very disappointed with this item.  It doesn't hold a charge for more than 2 hours at a time.  Once plugged in and charging, it gets unbelievably hot - my toddler picked it up and dropped it while hugging his hands to his body like he burned himself.  I thought he must have overreacted when feeling the warmth... but then *I* picked it up and thought - wow!  something is wrong here!  It would have burned his sensitive skin if he happened to have been watching it when propped on his belly/knees like usual - if he had sone so while plugged in.  VERY disappointed.  Would have requested a refund from Amazon, but in the Xmas rush we tossed the box, don't have anything but the unit and accessories anymore.  Will be contacting the company.  - Mom to John, age 4A fine printer- if you don't mind constantly standing over it and sheperding each page of paper into the machine. The automatic feeding works very poorly.I bought this, I received another type of swaddling blanket and my baby HATED this. She didnt cry more, she screamed more when I tried to swaddle. The velcro was not strong and the way it contoured to my babys body was not smoothing to my daughter.. SO buy 1, receive 1 and if your baby likes it... maybe it will work but it was to no AVAIL for me...What can you say, it's printer ink; it works; it's too expensive like all printer inks.I had a normal CF for my fuji 9100 but it was slow.After changed to this CF, the speed is greatly improved.The Sportsuit Convertible allows me to purchase one case for several functions. I can use it during exercise and the same one to carry my iPod to the office in the rain and the same case at my desk. Simply, a handsome durable case.The power supply cable was not work. So I chaged to my own cable. Now I can use the Hard drive. I think you need to check the cable carefully.works wonderfully with my fujifilm fine pix f20. Affords me a lot of room to record video.The modem arrived in two days. It was easy to install and increaed my speed significantly. Thanks. Ray THaving upgraded from a Garmin StreetPilot 2610, I was hesitant about the lack of routing options on the nuvi line. But, after a 2,500 mile road trip with Text to Speech (TTS), I can safely say that this feature trumps any of the advanced routing options that may be missing from this unit. It does have some quirks and you need to apply some common sense, but for less than $400 this is a real bargain compared to what was on the market just a couple years ago.THe screen display for the check register is hard to read and the display cannot be modified.  Very primitive by today's standards.  Works okay.A bit on the expensive side, but as gas prices continue to skyrocket, the ScanGauge is a must have.  Over the past two years, I averaged 26mpg in my '96 Hyundai.  By monitoring my gas usage on a real-time basis with the ScanGauge, I now get a consistant 33mpg.Don't waste your money on this useless, overpriced product.  It does not contain Norton Anti-Virus so just pay your $29.99 to Symantec to renew your 2005 subscription.  When I opened the box and realized how utterly useless this product is, I returned it un-opened, only to be screwed out of $24.00 by Amazon for a "restocking" fee.  Please, learn from my mistakes.It holds my sunglasses, cell phone, keys -- everything that I've tossed on it holds securely around corners, sudden stops -- whatever.  My dashboard has a slight angle to it, but it holds beautifully.  It's a wonderful invention at a wonderful price.After about 3 months of use, the water container warped from the heat and the cap will not screw on anymore. Not worth the money or the frustration.Despite the negative review feedback I tried this Photo Drive. It produces card errors in 2 listed cameras and does not work via an approved CF card reader with Windows XP. With XP it produces constant clicking-seeking noises and is not recognized.i use only epson quality ink in my epson printer for berrtr prints and photos and here at amazon i find the epson quality priced reasonably and affordableI love the surround sound and quality of this unit but it will not work with the HDMI from my Charter Scientific Atlanta 8300HD DVR!  I did try a Sony str-dg800 and the HDMI worked with that.  Now I am debating what to kepp and do with this setup.  I want to use HDMI w HD upconvert DVD and S/A STB if I can!It does what it is supposed to do... Plug and print. I like the canon printer.This works anywhere, unlike the iTrip that only works only in rural areas.  The sound is very clear & there is no static.  I would reccommend this to anyone who has a ipod & like to listen to it in their car.The Garmin 305 features are fabulous! What a wonderful training tool! The only "dark spot" is troubleshooting to download my workouts into the Garmin Center...Connected to a D-link WBR 1310 it did NOTHING.  A field strength meter show no difference in signal at 25 feet.has equalizer built in, mic recording capability, folders for organization, fm radio, mp3 encoding, lock, and on and on all with a very competative price.The software refused to install on my system. It's not worth sending it back for a refund. I can only give it one star because the battery charger function does work. BE WARNED: There is a special procedure for installing North America Windows XP Verizon LG. If you have this setup, as I do, the auto-install will not work. I couldn't get the special install to work either???send me the one without wire, exchange with restocking fee, i'm totally unhapy with it, is it my fault?After 6 months of use, the print server stopped working.  Anything hooked up to it (computers, printers, scanners) was not recognized.  Repeated inquiries to Keyspan for assistance in troubleshooting were ignored.  Very frustrating.Amazon sells this for $18.99, but Garmin shows the list price as $18 (and they sell it online for that price).  Amazon above list price?  And for a simple flat piece of plastic? Ouch!The handsets are dinky small and hard to use.  There is no answering machine feature on these phones...you must subscribe to one of those horrid voice mail systems per your phone company.  What a waste of $150 because it arrived while I was out of the country and it is now too late to return it to the off brand seller...this is NOT an Amazon sale...but from some fly by night group that keeps your money and the customer be ignored...or driven by a screwdriver. I am very very disappointed in Amazon and in this phone.A waste of money. The FM antenna is in the power cord, they say. I'm in the middle of a large city and only get about 4 stations, and some of those with static.Just received this product in the mail, it does ship with software to connect it to a mac computer. Amazon's specifications for this item doesnt reflect this. This was a big plus for me because the only windows computer I use is at work.The software could not be installed on my eMac running OS 10.3.9.  There were no instructions and tech support was of no help.  I was informed that there was minimal basic clip art on the CD's and to obtain the 2.5 million clip art items you had to sign up to access them on line.  Avoid this item.The software could not be installed on my eMac running OS 10.3.9.  There were no instructions and tech support was of no help.

Avoid this item.I agree with Khyraen 100% on this one. Completely childish and shows the hypocrisy of those who are supposely againsts spanking, and the baloney that they now need therapy! Imagine the outcry if someone made a simular "bumper sticker" about one of them. I have mentioned this before and I will say it again. This section is for REVIEWS. It is NOT a debate forum and it is NOT a place to launch personal attacks against those who share different views from you. Grow up!I'm having some major issues with the keyboard. The latest bios doesn't fix a thing.Problem shutting down and launching programs on the machine. Stay awayAll mac owners should get this if running 10.4 Replaces AppleWorks and reduces the need for Word products I publish a web site, click a button and you are in Must be a .me or .mac member to use iWeb.This person charge for every single item.  when you purchase 2 items the shiping will be ridiculous.It has frozen on me like three times, and once, it just wouldn't turn on, at all. Uuntil the following day it finally turned on. But I do like its simplicity. I use it very often.I'm a gadget guy and thought my wife would like this to carry around pictures of our kids.  Pricey, picture quality is very poor, and after a couple of drops of her keys the casing split.This cartridge was factory fresh and full of life!  Oh And it was half the price of wal-mart's or Office Max!  ;) Hope you enjoy?This was a software package. The cd had been opened and it was Scratched. I receive it by mail so who know what happen.Be VERY careful when purchasing anything from Visioneer.  I own a visioneer One Touch 9220, and just learned they have NO intention of providing a driver for VISTA.  Not only that, I had to PAY to learn that.  Their corporate greed exceeds belief.  If you think you might, someday in the future, be upgrading your computer, I would have to suggest buying some other scannerWe've run this software with no problems for a few months now, but after a harddrive failure and subsequent need to reload our Windows 2000 Pro OS and all other programs, we've had nothing but issues.  After reinstallation of VirusScan 10.0, it will not allow our IE 6.0 browser or Outlook mail programs to run- the programs start but the moment you click on a link or attempt to open an email, the programs quit.  Nor will VirusScan update itself without crashing.  McAfee's tech help pointed us to a manual uninstall program they have available on their website on the presumption that portions of the program were remaining after Windows uninstall and were causing conflicts.  This did not help.  We are now looking for a more reliable antivirus program.I have an Iomega trigger mouse that the trigger is a right click and it has the track ball that is thumb operated but it has 2 AAA batteries, if the lazer pointer button accidentally gets pushed in storage the batteries get killed. The Ultra has a rechargeable power but the trigger is to activate the positioning of the pointer only. You have to click with your thumb. It operates fine.I have an Iomega trigger mouse that the trigger is a right click and it has the track ball that is thumb operated but it has 2 AAA batteries, if the lazer pointer button accidentally gets pushed in storage the batteries get killed.

There's a left-handed version of this very mouse.Eggspert is fun. I was determined to learn history so I could win!1. This worked for me and transmitted forty feet, but only after I attached a spool of copper wire to the antenna, after prying open the case. I had to adjust the wire till reception cleared. Otherwise it was static. Before the copper wire, I had static in an FM receiver one foot from the Griffin Rocket antenna. 2. If you have a wireless router, the transmission from the Griffin Rocket may interfere with the router's transmission. I only know the router does not drop connections when I turn off the antenna.I experienced the same problem with this device as reviewed by others. Sudden changes in the brightness of onscreen material causes a resync. My setup is a PS3, HD DVR & XBOX 360 running into this switch, then a Yamaha Amp/Receiver to a Sony XBR TV. Every time a grenade exploded on an xbox game or any affect that caused a bright flash. The HD DVR experienced a similiar issue with sudden screen brightness changes or switching between an HD program and the guide. This is particularly frustrating when playing online games. The screen would suddenly resync to black and back to the displayed material in the middle of fights or major cinematic events. I guess there's a reason why it was only $40. I will be returning it.I bought this elsewhere for more money and was dismayed to learn that the black one doesen't fit my mx700 printer. Soooo I had to order a seperate black #5 cartridge.  Since the I learned that Canon has a 3-pack without the black.  Hope this helps someone.The picture of the filter is misleading, it has an additional blue layer on the exterior of item. Filter appears to do the job. For my hard water I flip the filter for a longer life.It does what I expect it to do with no problems.  It is inexpensive and so lacks some features, but I am very satisfied with it.Another computer ravaging piece of crapware from prosoft.  Like Drive idiot 1 & 2 this product does not work and is totally unessessary.  Time Machine with Leopard is awesome and it works.  Don't trust prosoft they don't support their products and charge for updates on 2 months after purchase that do nothing for software that does less than nothing.Occassionally crashes for no apparent reason.  After every backup completes, a dialog reading "...completed with errors..." appears, but no details show up and no error messages appear in the log.  It's impossible to find out what the problem is.  Very poor.Product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web. In addition, no "all region code" supportted! I will return it ASAP.The LED failed on mine less than 10 minutes after I started to program it.  Without the LED you can't set device codes or use learning mode, so it was effectively useless.  I guess you get what you pay for...This piano takes up tons of hard-drive space, and requires a minimum of 512 MB of RAM to run smoothly (plan to have 1G+ of RAM). But it's sensational. I've been after the "perfect piano" since I began playing keyboards in the early 80's.  This is it.  The way the notes linger on forever...the way they engulf one another without creating a mish-mash of noise, the way the pedal sounds, etc... it's all captured here....beautifully. I can't say enough.  For under $[...], you can have some fabulous pianos at your fingertips. a sample of it, from a piece called "Spirit of America", can be heard at [...]The neighbor kids and my grandkids stand in line for a turn to play this game.  I'd rate it as a huge sucess!The neighbor kids and my grandkids stand in line for a turn to play this game.  I'd rate it as a huge sucess!This quote is from arch-liberal Howard Zinn in 2004, not President Thomas Jefferson. A short Google search would easily reveal the fact, and the maker of this sticker either didn't bother or didn't want to know.This is excelent product, but it seems Profecional level item or luxery level, so it is kind of pricy for regular family usage - anyway I like it, but it is too expensive for meWhy do interface changes require additional 450 Meg over 2005 version?  Being forced to upgrade from 150 MB basic 2002 to EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEGABYTES.  Will next version require a dedicated additional harddisk?The LCD image is brilliant The photos are sensitive to movements, a tripod is not a bad idea The batteries run out fastlyI bought these for my Vonage service about 6 months ago.  I connected them behind my router, per their instructions, and was up and running within 10 minutes.  Since then, I've had one minor complaint that was fixed within minutes by Vonage (the time/date on the phone was not correct for my area code).  Otherwise, these phones work as advertised. I won't review Vonage, except to say that as a reasonably technically savvy person, I've had zero problems with the service in my year of being with them.  I have the $14.99 a month plan, and it all works just fine for me.At least for the rear seat of my Accord coupe, this seat cover was completely inadequate.  It comes in two pieces, each of which looks a lot like an elasticized bucket seat cover, and neither of which stayed in place on the seat.  Furthermore, there is no accommodation for rear head rests.  I have a hard time imagining how this cover could work on any rear car seat.This is a quality product (Toshiba) at the lowest cost from a quality retailer.  You can feel confident buying this product through Amazon.Solves the cooling problem where my CPUs are in computer desk that has a tight area with limited airflow.The handle fell off after 3 rotations. In order to get a non-defective one it would cost us the price of shipping to return the defective one.If this is anything like Check Designer, stay away.  My experience was that the program is incompatible with Quicken's updates, and needs a new patch every time Quicken revises . . .until the latest Quicken update, to which Check Designer is permanently incompatible with.  Their tech support responded only by emails and only on a 24-hour turnaround (so don't be in a hurry to fix bugs), then they send you one goose chase after another, but none makes it work.  And then they refuse to t refund the price because it's after a mere 30 days from purchase. . .  but we've been emailing for 30 days alone.  That's my last purchse from Avanquest.Tried to watch a DVD with the battery fully charged and found that there is no way to watch a complete movie without recharging the battery. Battery life should be longer.If you have windows vista, don't bother with this device.  It will not operate.  Once again Sony has given me yet another reason to stop buying Sony. To get the information off the device you are required to have windows xp.  They will not update a driver to accomodate a vista computer connection.  All because they have their own format on this thing.  Its all about protecting themselves and leaving the customer in the lurch!No instruction manual, a couple of paragraphs and I guess you are supposed to know how to use it. Help online answers questions that aren't understandable, if you could understand them you wouldn't ask the questions. No explanation of how to add a scan to a file or to email it. It's not intuative so I guess you need training(!) to operate it. I'd send it back and order another model but I'm afraid I'd get the same results. I checked at a local computer repair and he agreed figuring it out is not for the novice. Canon, be ashamed.......I guess I'll need training that cost more than your product.....Although it says that this works for ALL versions of Photoshop it does not upgrade from Photoshop Elements.  I spoke with customer service and they would not give me the code to unlock it.With a Canon printer that uses 8 ink tanks, this product helps save some money, unfortunately if you buy the 8 cartridge multipack you end up with extra red and green tanks, as they are the least used colors. The alternative is to buy this 4 pack unit then singles of photo cyan and photo magenta.Thanks to all of you who wrote reviews!. I will not invest in this latest generation of iPod. They need to improve on a number of flaws mentioned!!!Thank you. I ordered ink on the 28th and received it on the 30th...now that's what I call service :-)Baby slides down when incline pad is inserted while removed baby's head is hitting the head board.This item was a gift, I ordered it shortly before Christmas, and it was shipped immediately and arrived in time-incredible service. My husband-an avid mountain biker, is very impressed with the product and the numerous functions it performs. The price and service could not be beat!Over the last 45 years, or so, I have amassed close to 9,000 slides, in varoiud formats; 16 mm, 35 mm, 2-14" and 2-1/4" X 3-14". I am scanning and edting all the pictures for my family. The scanner does a wondeful job.Over the last 45 years, or so, I have amassed close to 9,000 slides, in varoiud formats; 16 mm, 35 mm, 2-14" and 2-1/4" X 3-14".

MAGNAVOX has declined servicing or exchanging after warranty expiration eventhough I was expecting to pay for repair/exchange.  They have basically abandoned a poor product.  Looks like I'll be the one abandoning them in the future.As another reviewer wrote (George Washington), I saw the positive reviews and was influenced by them.  This is a true dog. I too contacted (no phone) by email Kaspersky, received a number, no reply, then emailed them with the number, again no reply. A donation to the Salvatiion Army or a charity of your choice is preferable.  Like the other commentator (George Washington), go back to Norton or McAfee.  Both are superior. This doesn't merit a one, but it's the lowest allowed. It merits a minus 10!You can run, bicykle, skiing, walk - an anything else. You can go home and see it all on your computer - transmit it to google maps. You don't have to thing on a special route - you just run.....Short and sweet.  My dsm320 died.  My dsm520 died.  both just out of warranty.Tim Burton creates a stunning masterpiece that keeps all the parameters typical in his productions. Combining the macabre and childish elements with stop motion animation techniques, Burton gives life to a fantastic story, just as he did in 1993 with the superb Nightmare before Christmas. The store serves the director as an excuse to build yet another visual fantasy, supported by the voices of several of his favorite actors: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney and Christopher Lee. The ironic and funny style of Burton portraying death repeats itself, forming and obscure and complex world. The principal characters are no other but a dead bride, a colorful number of skeletons, some monsters and a shy and repressed young man. The plot of The Corpse's Bride is based on a traditional Ukrainian tale about a girl murdered on her weeding day and waiting since then for her true love. In a Victorian England village lives Victor van Dort, a melancholic young man pressed by his wealthy but uneducated family to engage to a broken but aristocrat young woman named Victoria Everglot, whose parents despise the Van Dorts but want to solve their economical problems with this convenience marriage. During a wedding rehearsal at the Everglot's house, Victor goes out to practice his vows, and accidentally says the words on a dead bride's tomb, who has been expecting since her dead for her true love to say the words that magically will free her to be happily ever after. From that point, Victor goes on a journey in the land of the dead with his new bride. Down there everything seems more fun and colorful that "up there", where the world of the living is, on the contrary, almost colorless, with and aesthetic close to whites and blacks, keeping the stiffness and conservative style of the Victorian Ages. Although the title suggests otherwise, The Corpse's Bride is a sweet and sour love story with a poetic capacity very suggestive and dreamy. True to his provoking spirit, Burton bets on surprising us, letting his usual black humor to disperse over an oppressive atmosphere while the emotional theme of the film, the loss of love, is told like a musical comedy.Unfortunately my Canon MP830 will only use Canon cartridges which are expensive. having said that I love my Canon all-in-one.Unfortunately my Canon MP830 will only use Canon cartridges which are expensive. having said that I love my Canon all-in-one.Life is too short because it is only 17 minutes at a time for 5 hours of charging. Lights up my entire street at night though. VERY POWERFULThe scanner came in about 4-5 days before the actual expectation date, and the installation was simple as pie. Within minutes, I had the scanner hooked up, and was scanning images into my computer.  Thank you Cannon!To correct an earlier reviewer, the bundling of these inks IS APPROPRIATE. I have a Canon Pixma MP830 and it uses the 4 CLI-8 cartridges along with the 5PGBK. You do not have to buy the bundle if your particular printer does not use the 5PGBK. Anyway, I checked all the major suppliers for genuine Canon cartridges (versus compatibles) and Amazon's price beats them all, especially with free shipping and no sales tax.Excelente Camara Digital. Deberian incluir una tarjeta de memoria para completar el kit. La calidad de la Cam y sus infinitas funcionalidades. Software y accesorios completos.As another reviewer mentioned, I received the unit and the antenna does not function (confirmed by switching it with my other antenna at home). With Amazon's return policy I decided to call Altec Lansing direct and they are sending out another antenna (about 2-3 weeks though). So I'll just use the unit in the MyXM mode until then.Our newborn (three weeks old now) has slept through the night since almost the beginning of her life. She wears the fleece kSwaddleme every night (we have it in pink and in ivory)... is there a connection? Probably! The one thing that could be improved about this garment is the noisy velcro tabs. Kind of counterproductive to have a pull-down flap feature that allows you to change a sleepy baby's diaper in the middle of the night if the sound of the flap being pulled down is guaranteed to wake baby! But that's a minor complaint. We LOVE the SwaddleMe!I have now had two of these in three years.  After a year or so, you ahve to replace the expensive battery pack.  I am very disappointed.This dock comes with NO cords so you have to purchase yet another accessory for it to be of any practical use. BOO Apple for following in the footsteps of Microsoft!Solid hood, reverses on lens for storage. Very rare I do not use this hood when shooting macro.The Rebel XT is a joy to operate.  As simple as a Point & Shoot when you want it to be, yet as advanced as a profesional level SLR when you NEED it to be! Now I know there are some features that the 20D has that this camera does not (ISO3200, and an extra 1fps) but thats all software controlled and hopefully will be unlocked soon buy our friends that brought us the Wasia hack for the original 300D Rebel. Buy this Camera!My Garmin Nuvi 350 is an asset to my traveling.   The only problem I find is that REST STOPS are not identified by Road number (e.g. I-75,  I-35, etc).its simple, 1gb of space and its kingston. Do I have to say more? i dont give 5 stars because it should have a lanyard included!It's very useful, especially for people that had had a heart attack.The only thing I didn't like was the size of the nombers For me it's difficult to read without my glassesI did a fair amount of shopping and comparing.  The price at Amazon and the performance of the Sharp TV are winning combinations.  The TV met all expectations.I did a fair amount of shopping and comparing.  The price at Amazon and the performance of the Sharp TV are winning combinations.  The TV met all expectations.At my house, this clock picks up the radio signal just fine.  At my office (where I use it) it doesn't pick up the signal at all, reducing it to a simple quartz clock.son los mejores componentes, suenan de maravilla, es impresionante el sonido tan real....Amazon says it is, Spectec say's it's not. 'nuff said. The disc comes with PC Only drivers for the Windows Mobile versions mentioned, but nothing for Palm.Awesome if you don't want to spend a lot of money on a mp3 player.If you're into Xvid, Divx, or WMV, you will love this box. Apple and Sony people will get frustrated because their proprietary codecs aren't supported. Apple and Sony both make similar units for their followers. Apple and Sony have built a fence around their customers and their customers think they are on the mainstream because Apple and Sony act like they own the media world. Wake up Sony and Appleheads! You can't even record anything on your players, it's all locked up, and pay per view, wake up!This player is sweet.  When all you want is to listen to your favorite music this is the player.  Plays music that you choose without any frills.  The quality of the sound is superb. Download is a cinch.  The size is unbelievable so you can jog or exercise without feeling any straps or bands. Doubles as a disk-on-key so just as easily you can transfer those other files.extremely flexible product!  i like how the seat moves, the tray moves, it is very washable and comfy!I have the black model.  The housing appears to be plasticized vinyl, but what ever it is the thing has a noxious odor.  I'm not one to be sensitive to chemical or plastic smells, but this thing reeks!   Not the kind of thing you want close to you while you're sleeping.I bought this to listen to my SansDisk Sansa MP3 play thorugh my car radio. The signal amplification so weak I have to turn the volume of both my car radio and the MP3 player to max to hear anything at all, and it's faint and fuzzy. In fairness, maybe the output of the MP3 player is faint, but it works fine through the headphones it came with. I have no choice but to return the unit.it is slower than the previous like model, for starting and changing discs.  I dont see any difference in picture quality.  The price here beat all other sites.Outstanding piece of equipment. No problems or complaints. Anyone who has issues with this device is probably way too picky.I have 2 of these - one on my desk @ work and one next to the bed @ home. I love the flexible blades and it moves plenty of air to make things comfortable.Both MP3 and CDs capability reduces the need for separate players.  Only negative is battery consumption.This software stinks! I did go online before buying it to be sure my phone was compatible and it was. But after purchasing it I have no luck downloading to my phone. And the program keeps freezing up and it's not as user friendly as it would have you believe on it's website. Too basic. Yeah, what can you expect for $20 - but, in my view, it's $20 wasted. Leason learned!It is wonderful. We can find places without checking a map at all. It takes us directly to our destination. We just completed a 2500 mile trip. It was flawless.Terrible product, CANNOT be filled up or it malfunctions.  Had to return it to Amazon and get a refund.The resume function does not work for audio books.  These are often 6-10 hours all on one track (secure WMA file from Netlibrary).  Without the resume function, playback always starts from the beginning.The resume function does not work for audio books.  These are often 6-10 hours all on one track (secure WMA file from Netlibrary).  Without the resume function, playback always starts from the beginning.Works fine.  Boosts signal and range of my belkin wireless AP.  I Like the magnetic base feature.  It's an antenna what do you want?If you are serious and committed to your training, regardless of weather you are a profesional, college or amateur athlete, you NEED the 305. Besides the HR monitor and GPS functions we all know, 305 allows you to pre-program your runs and specify the traninig zone your aiming for each segment of the day. This is the feature I believe will make a radical upgrade in the way you train and you'll become more efficient. Buy it now.Why does one black cartridge cost $20 and three color cartridges cost $33.00? It cost more to manufacture a color ink cartridge than a black cartridge because colored ink costs more to make. But as everybody knows you ain't goin nowhere without it! We are being taken advantage of by this company, college students need to spend more on an ink cartridge than a BOOK!! Please do not patronize this company, for once stick it to the man, so to speak.LESS THAT ONE STAR RATING!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS JUNK-Toys R US does not stand behind their products......DO NOT BUY!!!!!We have had our system with 8 phones and chargers located throughout the house and garages  four years now.  Only problem we have had is lately we have had to replace batteries in some of the phones.  After four years, not a bad deal.  We are very happy with ours.After installing Webroot Spy Sweeper, 4 spyware programs were indentified. When a request was made to Zone Labs for assistance in the removal of these items, they would only refer me to Webroot and would not assist me because ZoneAlarm did not recognize the spyware  at all.I have owned this item for just over 3 months, and have had no problems at all. Reads the cards just fine, have had no errors or loose fitting slots. Overall for $15 it serves it purpose, and performs well. No complaints. There is no adaptor for the mini sd card.Cappuccino is an Italian beverage, prepared with espresso and milk. A cappuccino is generally defined as 1/3 espresso, 1/3 steamed milk and 1/3 frothed milk. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino This is not what you get with the Mukka Express; you get 100% milky coffee after which you scoop out brown frothed milk. Taste is ok; presentation is consistently poor. Now for the bad news, this is a very tricky device to use and requires very special attention in assembling each time you use it. We found that attaching the top to the base, which requires screwing the units together, has a 70-30 chance of success; and with the failures steam and coffee will penetrate the rubber seal and flow unto your stove, resulting in a failed effort and necessary clean up of your stove. Conclusion: Unit returned.This Swingout mount is very sturdy and works quite smoothly. The inserts/grommets that provide protection from edges rubbing on your wires are ridgid and make it difficult to route multiple cables (component and power)through the arms. Semi-hard rubber might have been a better choice. All other features are of excellant quality.Slingbox works. Period. Yesterday, I was in the airport streaming Mythbusters through my Sprint cell phone connected to my notebook via USB.  Today, I'm lounging in a coffee shop in Hong Kong, watching a Tivo recording of CSI over wifi.  Tonight, I'll be at my friends house showing them pictures from my home computer, served through my Tivo, and streamed onto my notebook via the all mighty Slingbox. How will you use yours?  Get one.  It simply works.We had this product for only 4 months.  The on/off button broke after a month and then the screen broke on month four.  Called customer service and was given the run around.  In the end, we were told the warranty didnt cover the problems we had, and they could sell us a refurbished unit for 50% off.This item is such garbage!!!!  The only way the receiver stays on when docked into the boom box is by pushing down very hard and keeping your hand there or putting a water melon on top of the receiver balanced by a water bottle.  I've exchanged my boom box twice and receiver once--the manufacturer will not refund me, ahhhhhhh such frustration!!!!!!!!!  Not to mention 3 times I've had to stand in line at the post office and all the money spend on shipping and insurance.  Save yourself the headache do not purchase this product.Upgrading two Pentium 4 computers from Norton Internet Security 2005 to Norton Internet Security 2005 AntiSpyware Edition resulted in the loss of Internet browsing capabilities on both machines. Suggested solutions on the Symantec web site were of no assistance. These machines had run earlier versions of Norton Internet Security without any problems. E-mail access works but internet browsing, whether through IE or Firefox, is disabled. Turning off Internet Security does not restore browsing capability, the computer must be rebooted with Internet Security disabled in order to browse the Internet. Live technical support is provided only on a charge per call basis.I like the way it is set up but I don't like that if you have slippery floors it does not stay planted on the floor it slides on the bottom there is no support on the bottom just plastic so it tends to slideI really like the crisp sound on this player and the fact that I can pop in rechargeable AAAs, but my computer will not recognize this player. It locks up my computer when I plug it in. I have to go to my kids' computer to load it with music. Creative's customer service is a joke. I don't have any problem with the Muvo Mix, but the Muvo V100 isn't recognized, either. I'm disappointed that such a common problem can't be resolved.I installed the Microsoft Suite 2006 and then the Pinnacle Studio 10. The pinnacle Studio 10 caused my computer to crash. I then had to replaced EVERYTHING on my computer. I lost all my photos.At the risk of piling up the "unhelpfuls," I'd just like to question the warranty on this machine (and, to be fair, some other portable DVD players).  What does it say about the manufacturer's confidence in a $350+ product when both parts and labor are only warranted for 90 days? OK, so I guess in today's electronics marketplace, you pay your money and you take your chances, but at least 90 days/1 year doesn't seem unreasonable at this level.Beware that if you do a Disastery Recovery backup and think you can completely restore your computer in the future, StompSoft's PC Backup won't do that.  It did not backup my Palm software or my Sierra software or anything else that was in in its own folder in the root directory.  When I sent a note to their Help Desk, they were defensive and said that's the way it works.  I find it hard to believe that a Disastery Recovery backup won't completely backup your hard drive.I tried three different phones (same model) from three different vendors (thinking that I was one of the unlucky ones to receive a bad unit) and they all have very similar ringer problems -- Line 1 ringer doesn't work, or the phone doesn't ring at any of the extensions when you are on one of the lines, or it Line 1 rings but line 2 doesn't. I am very disappointed at the quality of this phone.  When I called Motorola tech support, they passed the buck to my phone provider saying something about baud rates and that the company needs to adjust it in order for the phone to work reliably.  What a bunch of crap from tech support!!!  I currently have a Siemens two-line phone that works just fine, so its obviously an engineering issue with the phone. I can't believe a company like Motorola would release such a sub-standard phone to the market.  How long have they been in the phone business?This keyboard is for Windows 98. None of the keys work. Technical support said that it had an electrical problem.I have tried refills, etc., but found the most economic approach is to use what the manufacture provides.  I find that by being conservative with how and what I print the I get by on about 1.5 changes a year.  I do most of my printing in greyscale and find it very acceptable.The Sansa e200e series is an excellent player/ viewer and has FM and audio capibility that most other units do not have. I beleive it will be the number ONE product sold, of its class, this year, Ipod look out, you've met your match -- superior!whether I'm inserting 2 sheets or 10 sheets.  The product spends more time beeping than shredding.  It does nothing but beep.  Hard to feed and A total piece of crapThis antenna pays for itself in 1 month's savings of my cable bill and the picture quality is amazing!I have "installed" this item and it sits here and collects dust due to the buggy , immature install design, you have to hook up cables to parallel and serial ports and if you don't have them then "simply" add them.. crap , Should be redesigned as a simple external box with usp2 interface.. this is a lousy product. michael Railey Dallas, tx.It works as advertised. It is a bit in loud end to keep in the room at night. I would suggest to place it somewhere in the outside of the room, if you are a light sleeper. It is very dependable however, as it has been working for over 2 years now. I think all humidifiers are laud by nature. Filters are reasonably priced at Amazon. And, you must change the filter once in while to avoid molding of course. After all, this device filters the surrounding air while humidifying it and captures a lot of dirt and airborne bacterias.The Teac is everything I hoped it would be.  No complaints -- suits my basic needs just fine.All I can say is  WOW  WOW  WOW  WOW  WOW  WOW  WOW  WOW  WOW  and WOW  !!!!!!!!!!!!Norton Internet Security is the triumph of fear over common sense. In the middle of other activities, Norton pops up a dialogue box that says "Norton has detected a threat." It doesn't name the threat. It doesn't ecplain why the threat is occuring if you have Norton Internet Security on your computer. So if you do the cautious thing, and say "protect me" Norton shuts down all access to the internet and your e-mail. I haven't been able to turn mine back on for 4 weeks now. There's clicakble tabs and clickable categories that all take you to the same useless screens which tell you nothing actionable. A terrible product designed by propeller-heads to please paper-pushers. Hey Norton, what if your prodcut actually communicated?This ipod has 44.1KHz 16bit stereo recording capacity.  Yet it seems NO suitable mics are presently available from either Apple or 3rd parties (e.g., Griffin says theirs are incompatible with this gen ipod).With Windows Vista and an HP5 Laser Jet writer, the cable was simply plug and play.  I didn't have to do a thing.The MP3 Player is not a bad deal for about $53. It is everything I expected it to be, except it drains batteries like there is no tomorrow. A Triple A Duracell will only last approximately 3 1/2 hours.I am unable to rate this item yet as it a gift for a baby shower. The box that contains the item, is dented , ripped, and has magic marker writing all over it. The invoice was stuck to the box, hard to remove and left a sticky residue on the box.As it is a gift this makes an undesirable presentation.The seller should have placed this box in another box for shipping which would have prevented this problem.It will work for a few minutes on my iPod 40GB, then everything freezes until I disconnect it. I've tried 5 of these on 2 different iPods, and the results are the same every time. Don't waist your money, as I did. If I could rate this product lower than 1, I would.I hooked this up and was on my way to dvd recording in minutes.I purchased this item in lieue of the Panasonic HDD because my local electronics store was sold out of the former.  Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews or check online pricing before I purchased, but I did confirm with the sales associate that I have 30 days to return this unit.  The problems I have are simple...  The TV Guide setup is not compatible with Directv (nor did they list the local cable provider for my zip code area) and that was annoying, but not a deal breaker.  The dealbreaker is that, when you do record something off the TV there is NO WAY TO DELETE IT. The online instructions say to press the DELETE button on the remote, but the remote I have that comes with this unit doesn't have a DEL button, nor does it resemble the remote in the users manual. Tried every other button on the remote but couldn't delete the test recording.  Hmmmmm.Item was just as advertised . 1 penny plus s/h. I did not do my due diligence and failed to note in the specs or in the reviews that this item will not work with a keyboard that was not USB compatible. My Bad.Gained nothing from this Hi-Gain Antenna. The magnetic base and cable was a benefit when affixed with a common shorty rubber wireless antenna but otherwise too expensive.  I wasted my money.This is awful like within 2 weeks it started to develop problems now its just frozen on me its badAccording to Amazon's own prices, ordering the four tanks separately is $39.34.  Why is $45 to order them together?The speakerphone on this unit is terrible.  The phone appears to interpret ambient noise to mean the user is speaking, thus muting the caller on speaker.  The end result is that you can barely understand anything the caller is saying, as the beginning and ending of every phrase is clipped off.  Stay away from this phone.This console fit snugly onto my Phil & Ted's E3 and I like how the deep cupholders pockets keep my drinks firmly in place. Just enough room in the compartment for my keys and wallet.i like it lights up when a call comes in, for the price you cant go wrong. only negative would be reviewing calls that you missedAfter unpacking the print server I was up and printing within 15 minutes on both printers from both computers in my network.  It took me a couple of minutes to get the utility "PS-Utility" to see the print server by disabling the Windows firewall and then discovering that I could add the utility to the exceptions list in order to enable to firewall again.  I am able to access all printer specific functions through the drivers as if the printers were connected directly to the computer. It has been a couple of days and I have had no problems. Configuration: -Operating System: Windows XP Professional and Windows XP Home. -Router: Linksys WRT55AG -Print server: TRENDnet TE100-P21 -Dell XPS Gen 3 Desktop connected to router via enet cable. -Dell Lattitude laptop connected to router via wireless link. -Printers: Cannon IP5000 to USB1 and HP Laserjet 5L to LPT3 of the print server.this is so cute i had one a while back but it blew the door fuses in my old pos achieva oldsmobilw ((dont ask me how/why)) but now i have a ford focus and it looks so cute and works fineI did a lot of research and settled on this one.It is very colorful and has a mobile.It has a lot of activities and music too.The seat is very comfy too.My baby loved and used it from about 2 months to 6months.Be careful of this listing. The name of the item is the Ultra Cordless Optical Mouse. The picture that Amazon has posted is for a completely different 5-button mouse, the GO 2.4 GHz Wireless Optical Mouse. Check the other pictures on the listing... those pictures are for the actual product being sold.The ink worked as intended.  Will purchase again.  The shipping for the ink was not a pleasant experience.  Not the fault of seller.If you want an iPod but you can't afford it, the SanDisk Sansa is a must for you. It might not have games but or time but it has a radio and you can fit up to 240 mp3's on this device. It's portable and stylish and very easy to use.It is a cool thing.  The product was delivered in timely fashion. There was some initial trouble loading the software, but that may have been a function of our particular PDA.  The only complaint was that the instruction manual was not very helpful. Once loaded, the device works like a charm.I agree with the many other users who have experienced the "Condensation, Operation Paused" defect on their JVC GR-XXX. Despite numerous others reporting this problem, JVC says its not a recognized problem. I would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs.This is the Pentium D 805 which was recently discovered to have some unusual properties that allow it to overclock at 4.1 GHz without major cooling. This is an industry marvel and has shocked everyone. Run a google search for "A 4.1 GHz Dual Core at $130 - Can it be True?" and you will find the HOWTO article on Tomshardware page. However you need to install at least a 500W PSU. Enjoy.I like the telephone and the 2 lines, but... The answering machine has 2 problems: 1.  It does not detect when the caller hangs up and keeps recording an anoying tone noise. 2.  Sometimes after you delete all messages from the machine, it still indicates that there are messages available although when you try to listen to them it reports that there are no messages.  This persists until you switch on and off the power of the whole thing.Although the 2007 version of this program is pictured and described, the ISBN and model number are for the 2006 version, which is what you will actually receive.BAD PRODUCT.

The 3 color cartridges are compatible.  The price for the 3 color cartridges usually runs about $40.  So do not buy this product for the Canon MX-700.Just got to use this Nuvi 350 this weekend. Just two words, Love It. Thanks Amazon.I received this product on time and am very satisfied with the purchase.   This GPS is everything that has been written about it.I bought this for my husband, who is a music fanatic, and he absolutely loves it!  He uses it in his car which has a jack.  He says it is fantastic!I was surprised at how simple it was to install. The three versions give you alot of various things you can do with each one. I want to keep changing from one scene to another. When my wife saw it, she was surprised at how nice it is.Do not worry what the others say it dos give you the one year FREEThe reason why I liked this software is that It covers everything (alphapets,Grammmer,...). if you are motivated, you will deffinatly learn Arabic Language.The performance of this machine is terrible.  Just opened it up, plugged it in, and after attempting to shred a few sheets (one at a time) experienced a colossal paper jam.  Put it back in the box to return tomorrow.  It would be more efficient and gratifying to scissor documents with pinking shears.It does not fit the keyfit30 car seat and i was surprised at how loose it was on the product. the picture makes it look like the material is taut. it may work for some ppl, but i returned mine.1.  The mini plug is too large for an iPhone. I ground it down to fit. 2.  Then when inserted in our Bose car audio system, it is ejected within a few seconds. That is likely because the Bose system has auto-reverse, and this gadget cannot cope with that feature, or it was defective on receipt. A waste of time. GiocmDoes what it is supposed to do, but paying $38 for a piece of plastic that probably costs 50 cents to produce is crazy.Works just like it should.  Cheaper than buying OEM part.  No problems at all.Like some of the other reviewers, my Toshiba D-R4 will not finalize a DVD-R disk (very frustrating after 2 hours of recording).  To add to the insult, the disk drawer mechanism has jammed with the latest non-finalized disk stuck within.  This is how it will be returned...I have just spent an hour trying to customize a certificate from one of their templates. No success! This product is not at all intuitive; the Help is not helpful; there is no tutorial; there's no explanation of what's on the 8 CR-ROMs included.  A waste of time and money.Nitro PDF Pro registered copy commences license failure warnings after 2 months. Now I want to uninstall it and cannot. It attempts to validate install in order to uninstall, so I am now a hostage to this POC software. Overall, I feel ripped off and the pdf functionality is cheap and limited for $80.Stay away from Thompson RCA products. They a junk and the customer service is worse!!This is not the MSI VIDIA PLATINUM SLI BOaRD, it is the ULTRA board and has only one AGP slots and is overpriced by over $50 over the ultra boards from other vendors and the description misrepresents this model board.  I was dissapointed to received this board that will not support two sli graphic cards as that was the objective of my new system build for my teenager for xmas.This is my third Logitech mouse and it lives up to the reputation.  It's sleek and comfortable and stylish.  I recommend Logitech products to everyone.This software simply refused to install on my computer.  I get the now famous _is2.tmp error message and that's it.  My system requirements are OK and I tried the clean boot, etc.  Same results.  This piece of software is the only one with which I've had trouble on this computer and I have installed a lot of software.  Encore support simply ignored what I told them in my inquiry and told me to do a clean boot inspite of the fact that I told them I had tried that remedy.Initially I liked this product. I've owned it 1 1/2 years and it died on me. I'm very disappointed.It serves my needs and is a quality product like the previous editions.Once you decrypt the game entry point, Math Blaster is a brilliant method for teaching basic math functions (+,-,*, /). The problem with startup is the lack of guidance on how to start the game. A line or two (in the UI)explaining how to start the game (after the arithmetic tables are displayed) would be a tremendous assistance for beginners. We were disappointed with the list of +,-.*,/ tables displayed until we accidently clicked the entry point with the mouse. The user is presented an endless set of arithmetic expressions which the user must discern as valid/invalid while exploring a labyrinth of shoot-em-up and donkey-kong type choices. Perfect for a 6 year old 1st grade student !Tried it on two cars and, as a check, three in-house stereo systems. Waste of time and effort.This phone is not all smiles and laughing and gumdrops:  the mute button makes me crazy.  Oh, the phone is all "la la la I love its range and clarity," as other users report, but my face hits the Mute button as I talk.  Unaware that my calls are muted, conversations break down into two kids with crappy walkie-talkies:  "Hello?  Hey, you there?  Hello?!" I don't suffer from Fat Face, nor am I mashing the handset to my cheek.  The phone is otherwise excellent. But I'm going to destroy mine.Needs more power and volume control for use with a laptop on a plane.I have a laptop with just USB 1 and this harware realy make the difference.Machine in it's self is passable. However the remote was DOA and the seller doesn't seem to be in any hurry to replace it. JOThis software is all about advertising.  It feels like Microsoft is trying to upsell me everytime I navigate to a different section of the application. As for the stability of the application, it's horrible.  I have setup bank accounts that disappear a few minutes after I start entering transactions, online payment dates are inaccurate (Not the fault of the bank), and online updates often fail until I clear my Internet cache. I think it's time to look at Quicken.Incredible player with lots of hard disk space for music. Plenty of options for third party accessories available for this product, with multiple vendors competing. The only gripe I have is - that it has horrible battery life..On somedays, it dies down in a matter of hours...I use this player to play worship songs through our church PA system. It is an effective player but you might want to invest in some rechargeable batteries for the unit since normal batteries have about a ten hour life span.I purchased this for my nephew who was thrilled to have an mp3 player only to have it and a replacement player die within days (freeze problem). I'll avoid this brand in future.I don't like this computer at all.  It sometimes takes up to 3 minutes for a screen change.  On occasion it has been slower than dial up.  The CD/DVD drive is defective.  It may be OK if all you are doing is typing a paper,etc. but not for anything else.This product is all that it's cracked up to be. I had purchased a Nuvi 660, but it's not designed fro geocaching, the 60CSx fills the bill.This is not the full Toast software - but the limited feature version that comes with CD burners.  It says right on the disc - not for resale - and it doesn't include all the features lists in the bullet points. The software you want is Toast Titanium.i'll gladly save money and take a dented box item - works perfect.My hubby and I installed this by ourselves in less than an hour, this saved us over $500. for a professional to do it.  I am so glad we did not waste our money to have a pro do this for us!!it was not working .. I think problem with the antena . May be I was unlucky .. Sent the product bakSubmitted Rebate which was rejected because I had only included the UPC code but not an inside flap of the box. It was stated once in the submission form but in 2 other areas they only asked for the UPC code. After reading the reviews, I don't have any confidence in the software and will switch to Norton. At least they are a respectable company.Tinted windows seem to play havoc with satellite reception, but with an aftermarket external antenna (sits on the dash at the bottom of the windshield and costs $25) it works just as advertised.I bought this item to go in our Ford Focus wagon and the pet barrer is about 5 inches to tall to fit into our car.  Your cargo area needs to be at least 39" tall in order for this product to fit.  Nowhere in the description does it tell you the minimum and maximum heights for this product.  Now we have to send it back.I'm very disappointed with the CD player.  After only a month and a half of having it, it doesn't read the CDs.  Such as waste of money!!!Product shipped was not as advertised. Rather, it was a generic version that did not work.McAfee has been trying for over three months to resolve various problems with the product disabling itself on users' computers. With an anti-virus product, of course, that's about as bad a bug as you can get. In my case, the product disables itself every time I use Roxio's Drag-to-Disc. The forums at McAfee are full of different instances of this same problem.McAfee has been trying for over three months to resolve various problems with the product disabling itself on users' computers.

The VCR to DVD works without a hitch and without heat buildup on the case.  It's just terrific. My one complaint is that it won't play VCD's or SVCD's.  This is probably unimportant to most people but before there were DVD's there were VCD's and alot of my children's video's are on VCD. Samsung has a convenient port on the front of the device to hook up an external device to record from.  So I have to hook up my old DVD player (that supported VCD) and transfer everything over to DVD-R. You'll not be dissappointed by either the functionality or the picture quality.  It is worth it if you have DVD's and a high def TV or you need to tranfer your VCR tapes and old home movies to DVD.Canon A610 camera and Windows XP recognized this card instantly, and it's super fast!This backpack is a must for anyone who needs to carry both their laptop computer and camera gear at the same time.This backpack is a must for anyone who needs to carry both their laptop computer and camera gear at the same time.In this video, I explain just what a TiVo is, how it works, and why it is TOTALLY AWESOME.reuces noise on airplanes by about 60% to 70%. Sound quality when listening to music is excellent.America says: Its ok to kill your child by aborting it....but please do not spank your children in trying to correct behavior.  Liberals make me laugh:)This product was as described. It is a normal thumbdrive with the only moving part was the USB protective cap that pops off. It was at an awsome price for $.89 plus shipping. One reason I prefer this over the SanDisk Cruzer is that this Kingston is not partitioned for drivers and unessasary files needed to run a thumbdrive like the SanDisk Cruzer series that popup everytime you install it. I do prefer the "Switch Blade" style thumbdrives but for $.89 it works and does what it supposed to do.Internal fuse is fine.  the flexable hindge seems to be the problem.  over period of few days in the end of its lifetime, the hindge required repeated flexing to get it to come on. I don't recomend this product.  21$ = 64 days  wasn't worth it.  Amazon only covers within 30 days, and Coby (if you can find them) wants $ after 64 days of use then to be without for 2-4 weeks.  I learned my lesson when buying online heed caution when others warn you.HaHaHa!my mother brought me to watch 'The Corpse Bride'yesterday.I eat a lot of potato chips on that day.This show is very funny;must watch.HaHaHa!my mother brought me to watch 'The Corpse Bride'yesterday.I eat a lot of potato chips on that day.This show is very funny;must watch.HaHaHa!my mother brought me to watch 'The Corpse Bride'yesterday.I eat a lot of potato chips on that day.This show is very funny;must watch.HaHaHa!my mother brought me to watch 'The Corpse Bride'yesterday.I eat a lot of potato chips on that day.This show is very funny;must watch.The flash drive has an excellent price for the capacity it offers, but the only thing i didnt like is that it didnt bring an neck strap so i have to carry it in my pocket all the time.I use a Mac.  In some ways the Brother software is PC oriented.  Nevertheless, it woks perfectly out of the box for the mac.  I use an airport express to print wirelessly.  The machine is absolutely quiet. No problems whatsoever.I think this movie is cute and okay for all ages. Tim Burton is awesome!!!Requires "internet required" tag for printing.  It allows only one printing and in only one key.  Any other key or copies has to be purchased again, defeating the purpose of this program.  Get the books and copy machine....Requires "internet required" tag for printing.

That out of the way, this sly piece of technology minimizes many random sheets of paper and gives the user that certain awed look from colleagues. **Be careful not to screw the pen battery closed too tight or it will tear/crack**.  There are too many functions to learn in the middle of a school semester so it is wise to plan ahead with this one and get familiar with all the capabilities ahead of time.  For example, I want to convert my notes to PDFs and txfr them to my e-book reader, but have no time to learn how. In addition to the handy e-version of my class notes, my daughter writes authentic messages that I send to family members around the globe.should come with my gps receiver.  i think it comes with the velcro--if not its cheap.  about time a mount works out of the box. this guy sells on ebay and amazon.  i think he is the only one that has this type of mount.My TV has just failed after only 3 1/2 years.  there are countless reports of other customers with the same problem.  Sony extended the warranty on other RPTV LCDs made around the same time, but they have not done so for this model.  Avoid at all costs.  100% failure rate.I've had my Brother MFC 8660DN for three days and up comes a "Fuser Error". Arggh.  Very expensive to replace.  Piece of JunkEverybody who gave it a 1 star rating is dumb. this is the product rating, not the website.Ok... im not reeealy a kid, im 14. Im gettin this computer but does any1 know if the video card is enough to play the sims 2 on????? i like what iv heard of this pc, the lightscribe seems cool, and it has 2000 GB memory! lots, eh? I think it is.... ok, im goin crazy, sorry, bye!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, and by the way... i forgot... bye!With "The nightmare before christmas" Tim burton proved that he knew the art of stop motion animation. With "corpse bride" he has done it yet again. Corpse bride undoubtedly remains one of the best animated films of the year alongwith "wallace and gromit: curse of the wererabbit" and continues the dark tradition of Tim burton successfully. Corpse bride will be out on dvds soon, available separately in widescreen and full screen editions, with all these haunting features: Documentary: Find out how an animator approaches his character's motivation and why individual animators possess unique skills. Tim Burton: Dark vs. Light: Explore what inspired Burton to bring the Corpse Bride to life. Voices from the Underworld: Meet the actors behind the voices, and see how they craft their unique character Danny Elfman Interprets The Two Worlds: - Inside the Two Worlds: Includes interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and production drawings. Music Only Track Making Puppets Tick: Step inside and tour the puppet workshop. Photo gallery: The Corpse Bride Pre-Production Galleries Production Notes BUT NO TIM BURTON COMMENTARY???? Lets only hope that is included too at the last moment!!Besides the recent Mac upgrade of the TrainingCenter app from Garmin, check out Ascent, available as a download from montebellosoftware dot com.   Ascent is fully compatible with the 305 and 205 and offers features that go far beyond the Garmin Training Center, like the ability to superimpose your route on Terraserver aerial photo-maps and playback an animated heads-up display tracing your route with speed, altitude, cadence, HR, etc.  Mac-heads should check it out as an alternative to the Garmin s/w.The only complaint is not with the product but with the ads. There was so many choices and features and I felt they could have been clearer. I felt they were assuming more knowlege of the product then 1st time buyers would have. This is my 3rd GPS system and although I loved the others they are built into the vehicle and the upgrades are more then I paid for this system. Their advatage is they turn on and off with the vehicle. I would purchase this same system or similar Garmin product without hesitation.Decent for the money, basic, no fancy stuff.  Not thrilled with scrolling wheel, but whatever~This product requires no effort to use.  It installs quickly and is immediately ready to sweep through your files.  On the initial sweep through, it corrected a serious problem caused by adware.  When it reviewed the files on my kids computer, it identified 24 adware and similar programs that had been installed with some of the web packages my kids use. The programs are quarantined for now but both our computers are finally working the way we need them to.Although this is as of this moment listed as in stock, I discovered after placing an order yesterday that they are in fact back-ordered. The estimated shipping date is December 22. So if you need one sooner, don't waste your time here!I continue to be very pleased with Microsoft Money and find the Deluxe version is all that you need for personal use.  However, the 2006 version does not appear to be a significant upgrade over the 2005 Deluxe version.I had it on my snowmobile for 20 minutes before it stopped working. I have to admit that it was only -10 degrees outside.I had it on my snowmobile for 20 minutes before it stopped working. I have to admit that it was only -10 degrees outside.a very fine unit, however, it seems the 370 is the exact form factor with maps for europe and is traffic equipped, not just capable. get the 370, not the 350.Hi there, My name's Chris Dahl, I'm the product manager for Nitro PDF Professional here at ARTS PDF. It's unfortunate that we have to make a post of commercial nature here, however we've recently noticed a number of bogus reviews appearing that seem to have been written by a competitor of ours. If you take a look at the reviews from the following people (click on their name to see both the Nitro *and* the surprisingly glowing countering Scansoft review) I think you'll see it's quite apparent this is the case. 1. Dan Allerbach 2. Chris Malloy 3. kelli wakeman 4. Anthony Alphiso What I'd suggest you do is download the trial version of each product from the respective websites and let you be the judge on the product. Feel free to contact me directly with any questions, my e-mail address is chris.dahl[at]artspdf.com. P.S. it's required that you leave a star rating when writing a review on Amazon, so I had no choice but to select 5 stars. What can I say... I love our product! Regards, Chris. ___________________________________ (...) ___________________________________The Heart Rate Monitor worked okay for about two months then became unreliable.  The heart rate goes in and out of lock.  Wetting the chest band helped in the beginning.  The watch display started to fade after about one year.  I was so disgusted with the reliability I decided to try replacing the watch battery myself....don't try it.  I disposed of the watch/waste band in the trash.......no loss.  The watch/chest band must be retured to a dealer for battery replacement.  After reading HRM reviews I decided to buy the Timex Heart Rate Monitor at Costco for $39 (user replaceable batteries).  All I need is a HRM that will show I have reached my target HR, I do not need all the bells and whistles, it's on the workout equipment.This is one of if not the best film of the year! The animation is fantastic! So is the Humor, and the music and the songs written by the talented Danny Elfman. The story is about a young man named Victor van Dort (Johnny Depp) who is engaged to Victoria Everglot(Emily Watson). But he can't remeber his vows and everyone (with the Exception of Victoria)is very critical about this! So Victor goes into the woods to practice his lines. So he puts his ring for Victoria on what apears to be a stick on the ground and says all of his lines which awakens The Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Cater). So Victor's wife is now The Corpse Bride! I won't give the rest away but I Highly Recomend this movie! It has a Variety Genre's to. It's a Drama Horror Musical Romantic Comedey. So see this movie! -Douglas "The Kid of the Arts" EdwardsI received the clock as a gift from my now deceased grandmother so I won't toss it out but the number one, so the clock can show 10, 11 or 12, faded out almost immediately; the backlight is worthless and it rarely connects to the atomic clock to update the time. I guess it was worth the $12 she spent.This unit takes a while to acquire satellites but then it's a wonder. It does all you can ask of it. The only major drawback is that Garmin charges for each additional map set that you may want.My tape deck kept flipping it over and after a few minutes spit it out.  That was a waste of money...I was very happy with the purchase until I had to change one of the colors and the cartridge was defective. So I feel I was shorted one cartridge and will I encounter more damaged ones as I use them up.This clock drives us crazy- when you try to shut off the alarm- the clock slides all over- (shut-off is on the side)- it should have been on the top! Poor design.I ordered these for Christmas gifts and all 3 were defective; reordered and 2 more are defective.  Recipients were very unhappyNow I know why Kingstone it's the most famous one! I have no problems :)I tried to use this switch with an Logitech Elite Keyboard (very standard  cheap keyboard) a mac desktop, a macbook pro and a Dell desktop. The macs are no longer recognizing the keyboard when connected via the switch. The logitech software doesn't recognize the keyboard. So I contacted customer support. It turns out that they DON'T GUARANTEE THAT THIS SWITCH WILL WORK WITH YOUR KEYBOARD" Here is their incredibly not helpful and illustrative response... "GCS1764 is tested to work with a wired standard USB keyboard and mice. We cannot guarantee that all of the special keys of your keyboard will work. Try to connect first your keyboard directly to the computers and check if the keyboard will work. You may try to use another keyboard and connect it to your KVM.

The plug that connects to the ipod didnt stay securley fastened. This product is worthless in my opionion.Though one of the more challenging pieces of furniture I have ever assembled, this media cabinet now houses our moderate collection of DVDs, CDs and VHS tapes in style. The fact that the assembler can determine the height and number of shelves is an excellent feature that gives the unit some flexibilty in usage.Just did not fix my slow pc or internet lock up issue.  All in all did not fix a real problem or issue with my system registry and was not worth buying for me and my issues.It is just fantastic. If Columbus had one of these , the history of the world--- , well who knows! I love it. The voice is harsh and the pronunciation at times is tough to follow. But all in all do not leave home without it.I couldn't get it to work, finally sent it back.  I guess you get what you pay for.I agree with most of the other comments.  The 440 file/folder limit is unfortunate.  However, if you are not committed to listening to every single song individually, there are many shareware tools on the web that will "join" or "link" MP3 files.  (search with "join mp3 files").  Make 2 - 4 min files into one 8 min file.  This could halve the number of files you need.  One hobby of mine is listening to movies in audio, by ripping the DVD audiotrack into MP3s.  I don't need 30 separate 3 min segments.I purchased this window mount and it  looked OK until I attempted to mount the plate on the camera. The one I received has a plastic folding handle on the camera plate mounting screw that is wider than the recessed area under the plate. Rather than ship it back I cut away the shoulders in the recess to provide room for the screw to turn.( Couldn't alter the handle as it has a metal pin that holds it to the screw) Then when the handle is folded down I have to use a screwdriver or knife to fold it back up as it fits so tightly in the recess that I cannot access it with my finger. The rest of it seems to work OK.This product works just fine, but if you bump the cheap plastic face against a wall, tree, etc it scratches and ruins the watch!I ordered this fan thinking it was white.  It is not.  It is mint green.  After receiving the fan, I contacted Supentown customer service.  It is Supentown's position that the ad clearly shows it to be green and nowhere in the ad does it say the fan is white.  Unbelievable!  How about nowhere does it say it's green?  Caveat emptor!!!This radio broke and will not function at all after in the 10th month.  North Star said it was still under warranty, but TEAC does not recognize North Star as a legitimate seller and will not honor warranty.  So I'm stuck with a $113 door stop.  It's doesn't deserve one star but I couldn't give it less.Product arrived in a timely fashion. I use it mainly with my exercise equipment which has polar wireless, and it works flawlessly.Retrospect is a terrible software application for the ordinary Windows or Mac user.  Both versions are complex and difficult to use, and the interfaces are extremely unintuitive.  To make matters worse, EMC will want to charge you $69 if you need help with this indecipherable mess.  I only hope that the Time Machine backup feature that debuts with Mac's Leopard version of OS X will finally put this product out of business.There are none in stock, and if you have ordered delivery is a gamble. My advice, if you have (as I did) an emergency, try a different product. Strictly speaking I have awarded 1 star for non delivery, so I have no comments on the product.iTunes now won't start, Windows itself won't standby or shut down and I am plagued by irritating Norton pop up 'status' messages and flashing system tray icons. Don't buy this product unless you want to bring on a world of PC pain.Norton AntiVirus promised two rebates on this product. The problem is, you have to mail them separately to two different addresses. And Norton gives you only one proof of purchase. And of course, both rebates require that one original proof of purchase. When I followed directions (which required a magnifying glass and 20 minutes of studying), I waited for my rebates. And waited. Finally I received a notes of rejection from both of my rebate applications, saying that they didn't have the proof of purchase enclosed. I know that at least ONE of them did! Norton has wasted my time with deceptive rebate promises that amount to a scam. I am now boycotting Norton because I believe this deception to be deliberate. No company can be this stupid. And if they could be this stupid, would you want them protecting YOUR computer?!For a busy CPA, especially during the busy season, it has been a tremendous help in maintaining client records effetively and efficiently.just picked up a pair at FYE for 9.99. how can you beat that????? they work as advertised and they fit fine.In the product Description they said: "With an improved outdoor range of up to five miles". !! I think they should write : "With an improved outdoor range of up to five METERS". ---((VERY BAD DISTANCE))---I was looking for a way to play my widescreen movies on my pc tried Intervideo's Windvd and some others no dice but this one plays em just like on my tv. Just buy it you won't be sorry.this gps is absolutely worth the money. I vel-cro'd it to my motorcycle and have had no problems at all. It does everything I need it to and more at an inexpensive price.On Amazon this product stated it was compatible with the Sansa e200 series.  I ordered with that expectation but it does not work.I've tried to stick with this dreadful keyboard, but I just can't any longer.  Pointer/cursor moves around on it's own, deletes text, etc.  Don't buy.This film is enjoyable in content and imagery. The voices are wonderful and artistically, the design is beautiful. There is a slightly morbid undertone that makes the film not acceptable for young children unless they know and understand the idea of death.After only 3 1/2 years my A10 series is developing "blue blotch" disease.  Sony customer service is useless.  This is my last Sony product....I have not received this item. Was I charged for this item? Kerry Patersonlots of storage room for your dvds.  not too hard to put together.  of course, I had my daughter do it for me!This product is practically useless; boring images, no variety, and hard to use. And of course the only way to know that is to open the software and once opened it can't be returned. I won't be buying product from this company again.This product is practically useless; boring images, no variety, and hard to use.

You have to stop your activity (be it running, biking or walking) to measure your current Heart rate, as your hand has to be steady. The calories feature does not measure the calories burned accurately and was off almost by 100 calories.This camera will become out of focus in a month. That is the reason it is cheaper. Look for a name brand next time.Worked only for a couple months (during which time it had to be inserted a few times to work properly) and then failed completely. Lost everything on it. Could not be formatted after that.very girly way to glam up my backend...the backend of my car that is lol -super fast delivery but u have to get ur own screws no screws cae wit this just the frameI bought this item to replace one of my Hitachi 4GB MicroDrive cards that bit the dust.

It works with two just fine.  The other one it dosen't most of the time.  But sometimes it did when I tested it.  If I have a complaint, it is that Apple doesn't seem to keep an up to date list of cameras that it works with (and doesn't work with).Act 2006 upgrade is an abomination.  I believe ACT 2006 will do for SAGE what Dbase IV did for Dbase.  I wrote extensively in the ACT 2006 product review before seeing there was a section for the upgrade.  I'm just placing this review here to direct you to the reviews for Act 2006.I received the bundle but there is no installation key for Shade LE. I noticed the someone else's review stating this same problem is no longer visible so I figured I'd post it again.The vacuum boasts an automatic cord retraction.  I received this vacuum and plugged it in and was pleasantly surprised with the suction. Then i hit the cord retraction button only to find that it didn't retract.  So now I was stuck with 20 feet of cord that wouldn't go back into the system.  I contacted amazon and returned this product for the same vacuum, only to find that this cord didn't retract either.  Overall I am very disappointed with this vacuum and have contacted dirt devil to find out why neither of these vacuums cords automatically retracted.  The funny part about the whole thing is that the instructions tell you to hold the cord to avoid it from whipping back at you.I ordered this mp3 because of the color, well the functions are good, but I like this cotton candy pink color, so I ordered it, but when i received the package, the color is totally not what i expected, that's why i'm returning this one.  (i'll post the actual color later on.)The Philips HDD line looks sleek and has some cool features, but all of that is wasted when you find out that the battery was factory installed and must be replaced by the factory at a cost of $143.73. Their customer service is neither apologetic or concerned about the cost or retaining a customer. My advise is to avoid the Philips HDD line like the plague!this product is excellent no tengo ninguna queja con relacion al producto. No tengo ninguna queja con relacion al vendedor, todo llego en el tiempo establecido y en excelente condiciones....I was lured to this product by a rebate which made it free. The manufacturer Computer Associates burned me for the rebate and will likely do it to you too. As for how it works no trouble installing like others have mentioned but it slows my computer to a crawl. After a while you will shut it down and then you can resume surfing the net at normal speed.I am a designer with 3D solid modeling software (Inventor and Pro-Engineer and ANSYS).  I don't know how I lived without it, I bought it for work with my own money.I sent it back after reading the instructions.  It seems that every time I would have to change from listening to tunes at my coputer to the use of the transmitter I would have to change the values in Start->Control Panel->Sounds and Audo Devices to use it and then change them back when I was at my computer. I didn't want to do that each time.  I have no experience in the effectiveness since I didn't actually use the transmitter.My spouse uses these headphones for both the TV and IPod and he loves them.  He uses a prescription hearing aide but the headphone's sound quality allows him to enjoy both watching TV and listening to music. BKSUseless for recording from satellite receiver.

If you want a less expensive screen protector of simiilar quality, try Clarivue.You can run it as it comes out of the box, or upgrade the firmware to on open source alternative.I don't know who copied who, but Jumpstart and Reader Rabbit have VERY similar software offerings - only Reader Rabbit did it right! (I am referring to the Reader Rabbit Baby and Toddler software CD.) While they both offer similar activities, Reader Rabbit is charming, interactive , engaging and fun.... Jumpstart is NOT.   For example, both feature an activity where you discover hidden animals - JS has only six animals to find total where RR has almost three times as many. Both have a music section where you can add and subtract from musical compositions as they play... JS  has one composition, a slow, symphonic one, RR has two, upbeat and fun songs. JS makes you wait at it's slow pace, and has only a few monotone congratulatory phrases... The shape exercise only seems to say "you're right, that's a square/Circle/etc." Another game only says "You did it - that's the blue flower, etc." . These seem so outdated and 80's technology. RR on the other hand has many varied and cute phrases to keep kids involved, plus engaging music and cute characters that anticipate and congratulate your child as he or she does the exercises. But RR instead. You won't be sorry.As mentioned by another reviewer, the Caller ID feature does not work with 2 lines plugged in from 2 seperate jacks (I have no way to test two lines on the same physical wire). Unplug 1 line, and it works. Plug it back in, unplug the other and it works. Plug them both in at the same time and it will say "Waiting for caller information" and never display the number. I have tried all combinations of settings.I've had mine 3 years with out a glitch.  I recorded my own announcements so that when a special person calls, instead of hearing a ring, my phone says, "Incoming call from ....."  Battery life is a bit limited, have replaced batteries about once a year, but i understand this is typical for phones that operate at this frequency.My camera (DSC-W100), batteries, and memory stick pro duo all fit nicely, neatly, and snuggly in this compact case.  The only drawback is that it doesn't come with a strap to carry on the shoulder or wrap around the wrist; instead it has a loop for your belt and a clip for a strap (not included).My camera (DSC-W100), batteries, and memory stick pro duo all fit nicely, neatly, and snuggly in this compact case.

I have a 55" projection TV that supports 1080i and when running components through this box received an unwatchable amount of intereference.If speed is important to you, then avoid Sandisk flash drives. Compared to  similar drives from other manufacturers like Memorex, Sandisk drives are painfully s-l-o-w.Other brands have an occasional failure and the disk has to be thrown away and anything recorded has to be redone. But I haven't had any misses with these yet.Please excuse the fact that this isn't actually a review, but I'm striking out as I look for info about the e260's expansion slot. The question is this: are these e260's compatible with SDHC cards (or only SD, the older, slower format), and will it support 4gb, 6gb, and 8gb cards? There are issues with some of the e250's. We have two of them, one is a "Version 2" and the other is not. The version 2 takes 4 GB cards; the other one does not. The Version 2 plays audible book files, the other one does not. We bought both at Amazon, and simply "lucked out" that the second one is Version 2. Mind you, they're both excellent devices. That's why I'm shopping for two more to give as gifts. Thanks for any help you can offer, or for any referrals you can make to a more appropriate forum.Very sturdy when placed on windshield or on mounting disks on my dash, glad I order 2 of themVery sturdy when placed on windshield or on mounting disks on my dash, glad I order 2 of themThe features are neato, but the designers forgot one of the basic issues of electrical engineering: POWER CONSUMPTION.  This thing lasts about 5 minutes on normal batteries.  Therefore almost totally unusable.  Very disappointed.I rent cars from Hertz that have their Nav system, Never Lost. The problem with them is when you miss a turn it takes about 40 seconds or more to recalculate your route. The Tom Tom Nav 5 doesn't have this issue. If you miss a turn the TT instantly reclculates for you. The directions it gives are flawless. I travel around the US and so far no issues with directions. A neat feature is you can mark your location and return to that location at a later date.Everything works as described.  Shipped when it was supposed to.  Wish everything was that efficient!What more can one ask for but an educational program that a kid loves to play.I have a beautiful baby girl who just so happens to have a bad case of colic.  These hot water bottles are the only thing that calm her down enough to sleep it off.  I have ordered three bottles now - one for home and one for each grandparent's house.This M type XD card was not compatible for my olympus camera. a waste of money. make sure you check your cameras compatibility with these cards.This device will turn your computer into a TV/Tivo anywhere.  A must have for anyone that travels.  Local sports, local news and weather at your fingertips.  And not monthly cost.  niceI am totally satisified with my purchase it arrived early then when it was scheduledThis shredder consists of a shredder unit which sits on top of a plastic bin. The shredded paper tends to fall in a heaped pile, meaning that when the shredder is approximately half full, shredded paper touches the rotating cutters, and wind back into the mechanism. If you empty the bin after shredding 20 sheets or so, it seems to work more reliably. This is a fuss. To empty the shredder, the top is lifted from the bin. It usually deposits pieces of paper on the floor. The shredder will strain to shred six sheets, and if the sheets happen to fold while feeding, it will jam. One or two sheets will normally shred OK. The shredder has several levels of safety features - turning it on requires flipping two switches on top, and the bin must be in place underneath - if you lift the shredder while it's on, it will stop. However, because the shredder jams so frequently, you may find that you will have to pull chunks of paper from between the rotating cutters, which doesn't seem a safe design.Works with my usb 2.0 MP3 player (rio forge sport) and my garmin etrex vista color GPS.It works on most cellular phones. That's a way to hide another phrase: "I doesn't work on all the cellular phones". In fact it's a hoax. It only works on a very limited number of cell phone makes and ABOVE ALL it is geographically limited. It only works in a very small number of countries. I removed the software in less than 5 minutes after installation.Very effective callibration device, particularly helpful for flat screen monitors; wonderful quality at a very fair price.These lights are not as bright as they are advertised to be - and I've had several die on me in a very short span of time. Very disappointed with this product.These lights are not as bright as they are advertised to be - and I've had several die on me in a very short span of time.

GoVideo computer (Customer support) hung up on me 3 times.  Nothing in manual about "Unknown Disc"  at all.  Strange we ALL have the same problem and GoVideo has NOTHING on it any where!  Methinks something stinks here!  (But my air purifier is on and it's obviously covering it up!)This device store and support most of the files i downloaded off internet. I have mythTV at home and need to carry all my mp4 contents to go. Here is the cool product that support dvd jukebox features and works like an entertainement center. it comes in 40gb. but support up to 300 gb hdd if exists. Cool stuff for geeks and gadget lovers. Hope the info helps.the order was extrememly difficult to complete online and the person on your phone help line did not a have clear grasp of the English langguage..that was unacceptable to meThis model TiVo is out of date.  It will only record Digital and Analog programs and NOT Hi Def.  You must have a Multi-Channel tuner card installed in order to receive cable TV channels -- this costs $1.50/month plus a $20.00 installation charge from Comcast -- plus the monthly charge from TiVo is $12.95 (as I recall) -- this is an EXPENSIVE proposition. I'm returning the TiVo because Comcast offers their Hi Def DVR for $9.95 for 6 moths, then $12.95 there after. Oh did I mention that if you have Vonage or cable telephone service that you MUST buy a wireless adapter for ~$50.00? This is not only an outdated piece of equipment, but a very expensive solution to recording TV programs/movies!I've had this for 4 weeks now and haven't yet figured out how to program it.  I did manage to download songs but it won't play them became because of a "file error".  I'm pretty computer literate but this thing has me stumped.I'm assuming that other people have other laptops in the V2000 series. This product does NOT fit into my HP V2000 laptop. I'm off to the HP website to buy the real replacement part since I'll know it works.I ordered this Scope from Amazon , which the seller was Adorama Cameras.After I placed the order , I noticed the customer reviews about the product and wanted to cancel it , but I learned that this order could not be canceled from Amazon and I had to contact with the seller .I sent an e-mail to Adorama Cameras immediately to cancel my order but could not recieve any answer.Next week , after I recieved the scope from the carier and opened the box , I saw that one leg of the tripod was broken.I suggest not to buy any products from Adorama Cameras.I purchased this mainly for my wife who loves her coffee.  It fits securely on the handle bars of the Bob Stroller.  It is made of very durable nylon/dupont cordura type material (webbing like material). The holder contains a zip pocket in the center for a cell phone, wallet, or other items of similar size.  I believe I have put my cell phone, keys, and wallet in the pocket with room to spare. There is a warning to not put too hot of a liquid container in the cup holders.  I imagine this is assuming the worst situation in which the cup holder would melt and/or the liquid would spill onto the child. We have had no problems with a travel type coffee mug that has a closable/lockable lid. An open type cup (no lid) with a hot beverage is just asking for trouble.They are liars and Bilkers, claiming that the level of transmission 5 miles In fact, he did not exceed 0.8 miles. When i asked them to clarify,  they have said that if you do not like it send it back to us , and we do not have any device with a range of 5 miles what is that??? Motorola FV200AA 5-Mile 2-Way Talkabout Radios - Pair but to use it for your childen it is very nice< but remember just for 1.5 km max. in free areaThis program is horrible.Symantec doesnt care about you programs or data.They only want your money.Their support is run by idiots who know very little about their crappy products.I lost all my games,and my superfast dell machine is now a planter.your suuppot was useless.You could hire people who have brains,but that would hurt your bottom line.Its been reported you are having a banner year.yeah riping off your customers.A must to avoid,from a kid who knows.This is a rich collection of paintings by Rassouli,an internationally known artist, and each one is enhanced with lines of verse from the poetry of the classical poet, Rumi. The quality of the selections make every month suitable for framing! It is a rare opportunity to have these available at this price! There is a mystical quality to this visual walk through the garden of the heart that sets it above other calendars. The calendar includes sample text from a book that will be published in the near future called "Rumi Revealed."  You can't go wrong on this one! N.StoneThe cable does what it is meant to do, which is more than good. It allowed me to use my Sharp 26" LCD TV as an external display for my MacBook Pro laptop.The cable does what it is meant to do, which is more than good. It allowed me to use my Sharp 26" LCD TV as an external display for my MacBook Pro laptop.The Amazon Product Description for this item is badly incorrect. It states that the phone has the important "HOLD" feature, but it DOES NOT have HOLD. No one is checking what is being advertized (especially "auctionsmith"). BEWARE.I am another one of the customers that is having trouble with this lens and the autofocus on a Digital Rebel XT.  It locks focus less than 50% of the time.  My other Canon lenses don't have this problem.This is my fourth GPS. While on a search mission, my Garmin Vista was unable to locate me under a dense canopy in steep terrain. I had to purposely leave my search area to orient myself again. I vowed not to be placed in that situation again. The Garmin 60Csx located 5 satelites instantly under similar conditions and had me fixed within 20 meters in exactly 60 seconds. That was right out of the box. Fabulous!This product shipped from a third party seller listed on Amazon. There was a software problem as well as a problem with the rechargeable battery. As soon as it was removed from the charger, it powered off. Repeatedly. When the seller was informed of this he said there was no guarantee on electronic products and so I was stuck with it. This seemed unfair especially since I had paid over $ 460 for it. I am a regular shopper from Amazon and I find myself at a loss about what to do.I ordered this model recently as a gift for my wife, who loves to listen to music while she works on crafts and scrapbooking.  I was very upset to see that when I opened the box to test the CD player, it would not read a single CD!!!  The readout is just blank as the player continues to spin and spin and spin pointlessly.   I should have read other reviews for RCA and Thomson products more carefully, as this seems to be a common problem.  Don't they test these things before they sell them?  I am sending it back to Amazon for a refund.  Unfortunately, my wife now has to wait for her birthday present. :(  Buyer beware of products from this manufacturer...While this case will indeed protect the Palm, it can easily be damaged if dropped.  Thus, one of the hinges on the cover of the case cracked after a drop or a bump in my backpack.  The case is now a two-piece and I'm in the market for something that might last longer than four months.  Look elsewhere.Despite the "Tech Specs" of Amazon, the WD NetCenter does not support RAID 1 (mirroring) configuration.  According to a Western Digital representative in their forums, "RAID functionality was tested with this device but was not implemented on the final product due to lack of interest from our beta testers. This feature may be implemented on future enterprise based external products, but will not be implemented on the NetCenter hard drive."This runners watch delivers everthing. It is light, comfortable and accurate. The software provides a terrific way to review your training history and plan for improvement.I wanted this remote to work with my Kenwood stereo, it worked with the TV just fine but it wouldn't for the stereo.Very simple to use: when my (young) daughter gets lost, she pulls out the GPS, plugs it in, and finds her way home (or to a friend's house).  We don't use the window mount because we are worried about theft and smashed windows; instead, we just lay the unit on the console and listen to the directions.This is a piece of junk. It did work, but very crappy sound quality. $1.61 plus S/H = $4.59 what a waste of money.  I should have brought the Sony for just $12Due to the problems with delivery, the shipment did not reach me. I waited a week after the last date of delivery and emailed the vendor. They were very prompt is fully refunding me the whole amount, no questions asked. I would trust this vendor the next time I am buying online.A local pro audio store sold me one of these with the claim "It is the only serious recorder capable of pro results."  There may be some truth to that.  With the SPDIF in, you have some serious options for a front end signal chain.  However, after a year or so, the battery ceases to hold a charge.  Then what is it?  Junk.A very practical solution, i use it for my Graco stroller, of course it won't perfectly fit it, but i don't have to search for blanket on the floor anymore.I've had the transmitter about 4 weeks and it works flawlessly.  Occassional static sure, it is afterall linked to the radio, but overall I love it.I gave this to my college student for Christmas.  It will not only play her favorite (and hard to find) music, it can record her professors, or replay their MP3 or movie style lectures, if they post them online.  I'm afraid all of that studious activity will have to be stored on the expansion disc, though.  She's already filled her 4 gig drive with her music.  *sigh*it interferes with my wireless linksys system,it wipes it out despite changing network frequencies,I gave it away to a relative who does not have the same the same situation hopefully he will not have the same problem.This camera is awsome cause you can store music on it and take pictures too, one of the only stupid things is... it doesn't work on a tripod so, i suggest you don't buy a tripod if you buy this camera.I travel extensively by plane and these headphones allow me to escape the chaos of air travel.  The sound is amazing and it feels like you are in a concert.  No more crying babies and chatty seat mates.  I highly recommend these.I received the Jump start for Christmas last year and have tried to use it twice with no luck. Can anyone tell me the proper way to hook it up. I can't find my booklet for it ? Thank you. "Frustrated."There are faster cards out there now, but these things still fly. 40-50 FPS in FarCry 60 FPS in Doom 3 55 FPS in Halo All at 1024x768 with highest AA That being stated, the card does bottleneck on newer titles. Don't expect Battlefield 2 to run any faster that 25-30 FPS with AA/Af at 1024x768. The same goes for FEAR. But, on the other hand, the x800-based CrossFire Edition card is just around the corner, and this would prove to be a cheap and effective route into multi-GPU video processing.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!  Works just as promised.i like it ,but i cant use it bec it can drive my flush dribe.i dont know why for me useless. i would like to rtn it if dont need to pay handiling .I had mixed results with this machine. As others write - you must follow the instructions to the letter. I must have been doing something wrong, because I had lots of problems. If you buy one of these machines, you *MUST* keep your eye on it while it's on the stove. Don't turn away... It can boil over and create a collossal mess on your stove. If you buy one, make sure the seller has a liberal return policy in case you have problems. The other thing I didn't like was that there's a lot of cleanup after you brew your cappucino or latte. Some of the new modern machines require almost *NO* cleanup.this fixture  is  compact and  useful  the hinge - like  articulation allows a range of positions  , it  is  close  to the wall  to  hide  the mechanism  from view....  be sure to anchor  it  to  a stud  so it can support  the   tv   and  not  pull  when the tv is  attachedThe card is fast and reliable in all conditions. It comes with file recovery software and a life warranty, a no brainer for today's lg file size DSLRs.My hope was to use this for a Logitech I-touch multimedia keyboard with a PS-2 output.  The keyboard just flat-out didn't work with this adapter. Don't know why.cost me $ 280 plus 84 dollars for the virusbarrier. stay away!! fparrisThe list includes Roadmate 1200 as one of the models this mount is compatible to and is NOT true!  It is not compatible if it does not come with the cradle that holds the mount and the GPS unit together.  Waste of time and money.  Why sell half a product?  The mount should include the piece that allows you to connect it to the actual GPS!  HORRIBLE SELLER!!!  Will not buy from them again.The list includes Roadmate 1200 as one of the models this mount is compatible to and is NOT true!

The video allows you to virtually "poke your head in the room" without having to move your feet. The comfort of knowing the baby is just stirring versus the baby's foot hanging out of the crib is worth it alone. This product has a very capable battery. The microphone is super sensitive where it picks up the faintest of breathing from our child. The camera is clear in day or night and the swivel makes it fit in any corner.Probably my favorite comics of all.You just gotta love the characters and all of the action. EnjoyProbably my favorite comics of all.You just gotta love the characters and all of the action. EnjoyI was not impressed at all.  I have more components than jacks on my television, so I eagerly awaited the arrival of this switcher.  After following the directions and installing the unit, I noticed severe degradation in video signal.  It is now sitting somewhere in my closet.Product was as described but package did not include the lanyard that was included in previous purchases. It would help if advertiser would alert purchaser that this package was without the lanyard.I agree with the other review who gave it 2 stars. text editor is worthless. No spell check. No word count. whats the pointTHis switch was attractive to me because of its price.  All I needed was a switch for video, keyboard and mouse.  I do not need audio.  As a video and keyboard switch, it works as advertised.  However, with my PowerMac G5, and a Mac Mini, it cannot handle the Mighty Mouse.  Most functions of the mouse do not work.  So, I was forced to use two mice.  While not too burdensome, it sure limits the functionality of the switch.Everything I expected (for the most part)...My only request of the product would be to improve the on screen (TV) navigation as it is a bit oversimplified and doesn't provide the robust navigation of the iPod itself.The film scanner on this thing is fantastic.  You just feed in your strip of negs and within seconds it gives thumbnails of the entire strip.  I do both black and white and color and it gives perfect renditions each time.  My experience has been poor with film scanners until now. The software is very user friendly plus it comes bundled with Epson's photo imaging software instead of that crappy adobe photoshop most vendors throw in. Dan WilsonThis machine worked only for about 3 months.  I wanted to copy my VHS collection of movies onto DVD so I could dispose of the VHS tapes as players are becoming very scarce.  It is now useless.  It cannot dub or burn anything to DVD.  I wasted my money, don't do the same.This machine worked only for about 3 months.

The drives is detected in Windows XP, registers itself as a device,  but after that data transfer cannot be done, coz of I/O errorsI just ordered a system and realized that there is a major problem with the phone dialer. The console of this system works with an oridinary household phone jack. What it means is that the system can NOT dial out in case the phone line is busy. So an intruder can simply pick a phone, make the line busy, and thus disable the dialer. Professional alarm systems use a special phone jack, RJX31, which lets the alarmm system "hijack" the phone line, meaning they can dial out even if the phone line is busy.iPod Classic, in my honest opinion, is the only way to go. Classic is the only iPod that offers such large capacities, and the 30GB size barely fits my entire CD collection.My wife for years was shy about driving by herself. Now she punchs a few buttons  and away she goes. She just loves all that it can do. Thank You Garmin Garmin 350 NUVISame your money, this is a real piece of garbage.  I've seen some real junky electronics come out of China, but this is top grade trash.  It appears to have cost five cents to manufacture and works like one cent worth of plastic.  I can't believe that amazon.com has it listed on their web site.I received it struck of the opposite part (Display) and as I strayed the original packing I could not return it.  Did not mean but is a mess.catches dust and all possible dirt inside it, i threw it away after few weeks of use.Amazon claims this works with the MX700.  The color inks do, but not the black.  Be aware that if you buy for the MX700, you need to throw away the black (you need a CLI-5, not the CLI-8 included).Unfortunately all the channels they provide have some broadcasting in my area and the sound sounds like a weak muffled FM station.  Glad it works for others but doesn't work for me.My friend had this for her grandkids and they loved it -- so I purchased one for mine to use.  The only bad thing is we have handicap toilets (sit taller) so this will not work for a taller toilet -- it only works on standard height toilets. So I gave to my daughter-in-law and she loves it -- saves cleaning up the messy pots that come with the tradtional trainers!Although this ink may be fine for the correct printer this ink does not fit the MP620 as Amazon suggests. The MP620 uses the CLI-221 color cartridges and the 220 black cartridge . I have been very pleased with Amazon in the past but in this case they are incorrect.The product works as advertised. The only problem I have with this is that the buckle is hard to undo when you are done with your workout. The treadmill recognizes the polar as I step on to it. Allows a hands free cardio or fat burn workout.What an awful application!  There is ZERO support.  I have send a dozen emails to these people and get nothing but automated returns directing me to the FAQ which I've read through completely.  They say they're there 24.7...but not for the customer.  The application just doesn't work!  I had to uninstall the firewall to use my vista machine, the Anti-virus stops my outlook cold.  The "repair" stuff just tells you there is a problem, but not what it is.  Beware of having this software clean up the "Clutter" for you, it will just as likely erase your OS and its components. Look for better solutions from symantec or macafee or about any other company.Initially I was okay with this toy.  However, the plastic is hard on a lot of the pieces and I thought my baby might injure himself, he didn't.  The part that I am most unhappy about is the book like tabs with stickers.  The stickers have worn away with teething, most likely swallowing it.  I will not use this product again.Problem: Dark staircase. No A/C outlets. Solution: Maxxima MLS-01 Occupancy Sensor LED Lights. We placed one at the bottom and one at the top of our staircase. The sensor knows day from night, thus saving battery life. The light is bright, but not over powering.As a regular Norton customer and as a tech-support professional, I must tell you that this product is garbage. The software doesn't function properly and is annoyingly buggy plus the costly tech-support is absolutely shameful.We installed this unit as instructed.  Once in place, my phone showed 4 bars beside the transmitter.  As soon as I tried to dial my phone, it quickly dropped to <1 bar, and the phone call was dropped each time. I did not have any luck with this item, and thankfully Amazon accepted the return with no problems.Poor documentation for the Epson V700 scanner, in fact there is no written documentation. For example, to get instructions for loading and scanning a film strip you have to wade through a cumbersome file-a so-called User Guide. Considering the price of this scanner, the least Epson could have done is furnish a User Guide on a CD.IT SQUEEKS LOUD CAN'T LISTEN TO THE CD BECAUSE THE CASSETTE ADAPTER SQUEEKS TO LOUDI tried four copies; three were bad, one was awful.  This lens has been very favorably reviewed, and I find their 50 f1.4 to be magnificent, so I took a chance.  The only thing I can think, based on what I saw in the files, is that in each case, one or more of the elements was out of alignment, because they didn't produce a normally focused image at any focus distance.  Something 10 feet away on one side would be in focus, and something fifty feet away on the other side would be.  Very strange.I am returning this unit because of poor AM reception (I listen to talk radio) and because you can't turn the unit on or off via the remote control.Stay away from this program. It messed up my computer to where I almost had to reformat the hard drive. Luckily, it looks like I'm OK just restoring the computer to an earlier date. I've reinstalled Norton Internet Security 2007 only and am praying that works okay. There's a reason all of these reviews are so negative. Norton, how could you???Received this as a gift and when our Ruth grew to be too heavy for the hand-me-down bjorn we had, this hit the spot.  I am 6'3" my wife is 5'4" and it adjusts easily to suit both of us.  The back support is a life-saver and Ruth loves cruising in it.  Definitely a must have in our house.this phone is designed to be magnificent work of art, once you hold it in your hands you feel its beauty, but i have to say that it lacks mp3 player, , blue tooth, video for only 30 seconds... but after all it still the most BEAUTIFUL ....MsNadi: To answer your question in the review below, the ER6i model is white because they're supposed to match the color of the mp3 player they're designed for: the Apple iPod.  I was actually glad that they were white.Upon receiving this router, I flashed it with DD-WRTv23. This is simply a spectacular router when combined with this firmware. For the price I paid from Amazon, I should have gotten 3 or 4 of them.I am very happy with this purchase.  The item is very compact and is an excellent way to protect your HDTV DLP system in the event of a power surge or power failure. It is important to note to all HDTV owners that if you are watching your HDTV television and you have a power failure, the television will continue to run until the battery power in the Monster HPUPS500 is fully exhausted.  This is not the intent of the Unit!!! Please remember, that it is VERY IMPORTANT for you to turn "OFF" the television as soon as the power is lost.  This will preserve the battery power in the Monster HTUPS500 to keep the fan running for a short period of time that is necessary to preserve the bulb life in your HDTV. If you don't shut the power of your television "OFF" during a power outage, the television AND internal fan will continue to operate and BOTH shut down at the same time when the Monster HPUPS500 exhausts all of its power.   The intent of this unit is to power the fan for a short period of time (not the entire television) necessary to cool the bulb. Hope that helps. gbhI plugged my Nano into this charger for about 10 minutes and picked it up to check it out - it almost burnt my hand. My Nano is now Toast! I hope it just toasted the battery and not the whole device.This progam allows you to evaluate compliance and determine root causes of occupational injuries and illnesses.  The numerous reporting options give you the ability to view your data in a variety of formats. The desktop calendar tracks equipment maintenance, calibrations, medical exams and sampling dates.  So much information all in one place.yeah I had the same problem everyone else had, the player froze at the start screen. But i'm having a replacment sent to me and I think all the bugs are worked out.Works fine with SD cards but Siig support confirmed an issue I was having regarding xD media not mounting on Mac OS X... We did not market this reader/writer for Mac because of compatibility issues with xD cards in the Mac, there is no fix for this issue. However, we will update to a different version soon that will be fully compatible in Mac OS 10.4.7 or later.Ordered two fans. One was defective and other was n't effective. Another thing, they do not rotate.This is a horrable mp3 player, on the second or third time I tried to dowload music on it it froze up my computer and it did all of these wacky things to the mp3 player. I knew someone else and the same exact thing happened to them to, and it did not just happen to me just once but twice on two different mp3 players!When you plug into the USB port on your computer, windows makes the connection sound, but it won't automatically plug and play to load the appropriate driver.  You basically have to do an "Add Printer" and know which USB port it is connected to. But since you only have to do that once ... no biggie.This Toilet Trainer seems like it could break easily.  I wish I had purchased two separate items, the footstool and the seat.  I like that it sets the baby forward on the ring, so he can bend his legs, however, this is the only thing I like about it. I'm worried that the plastic nuts and bolts will strip or give out.  He's not too interested in it since he figured out that when he gets up on the step, there's no way to turn around without my help.  It does not seem stable or safe.Depp gives a touching emotion to a character that outshines all!  Music is fantastic!  Buy this for that alone!!!I had been skeptical of software which purported to cleanse the registry but this product does exactly what is claims. On the first scan I freed up over 2 gigs of harddrive space. It continues to inform me when I need to cleanup and not one scan has affected my programs adversly. I recommend this product for everyone.This rail is not the cutest (like some that display characters), but I gave it 5 stars because it is the ONLY one I found that could function with a bed without a boxspring (though the product does say it's for use between mattress and boxspring).  Plus, it comes all in one piece, so you just pull in each direction to snap into full size and it's assembled.  I had nearly given up on locating a safety rail for my daughter's new captain's bed and was very relieved to find this one.I spoke to Microsoft tech people before purchasing this item and was advised that it would do all that I wanted it to do for my company. When I received it, the program did NONE of the functions that I was quie specific about. I was very very disappointed. Additionally, the program is complex, "too busy" and the only user guide needs to be downloaded. Totally worthless program...I rate it a -5. I did however voice my dissatisfaction to Amazon and they have stood by their customer for which I am very appreciative of.We purchased these to use on a cruise ship during vacation.  The range was not sufficient to be useful.  If you are purchasing for this purpose suggest you look at something with more transmitting power.This watch is simple to use.  The instructions are very easy to follow.  It's fun being able to see my heart rate while I'm exercising.  It works with the heart rate monitors on the equipment at my gym.  I don't have to hold on to their handles.  The signal is transmitted from this heart rate monitor to the treadmill, elyptical, or whatever, and shows up on the screne. I wish the watch had a stopwatch and a light.  No such luck.I've have been a loyal Norton User since 2000 and I have had no problems at all. Norton has stopped Dozens of Virus's,Hackers and other malicous stuff that have tried at my computer I have to say I would recommend Norton cause it has helped me with virus's and firewalls all these year and no problems.The MP3 player works fine but there is not FM radio in it. Beware of what they sell you. Other wise its ok.Can't power on. Freezed at beginning. Computer can't recognize it any more. Recorded voice is very low. If you buy it, prepare to throw it soon.I had the same problem with the SMCS-T copyright protection format as the other reviewer mention. I could not connect my Motorola HT820 bluetooth stereo headset to it. However, there is a workaround (caveat emptor): 1) Download and install Toshiba Stack Ver 4.00.23. You can download it from: http://aps.toshiba-tro.de/bluetooth/ 2) Edit the windows registry. To do so: 2.a) create a new txt file and paste the information below. -------------- SCMS-T.REG --------------- [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Toshiba\BluetoothStack \V1.0\EZC] "ShowAvContentProtectionMenu"=dword:00000001 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Toshiba\BluetoothStack \V1.0\AV] "NoHeader"=dword:00000001 -------------- SCMS-T.REG --------------- 2.b) Rename the file SCMS-T.REG 2.c) Double click on it. When Windows asks "Are you sure that you want to add the information in SCMS-T.REG to the registry?" Click yes. After doing this "AV Copyright Protection Setting" is desactivated. In case that you need to activate it again, go to Bluetooth Manager -> Options -> Other Now, there is an option to activate and desactivate it as you please and you can connect any stereo bluetooth headset. I'd given this dongle 4-stars because: a) You have to tweak the software to be able to connect to some stereo headsets. b) The AVCRP profile only works with a few players. I know that it does control Windows Media Player, WinAmp, and WinDVD; it doesn't control iTunes. Other than that, it's an oustanding Bluetooth USB adapter. It supports the following profiles (Toshiba Stack): SPP, DUN, FAX, LAP, OPP, FTP, HID, HCRP, PAN, BIP, HSP, A2DP, AVRCP, and GAVDP.I just received this mobile as a shower gift and installed it on our crib.  It is advertised as being super quiet but I am finding that it seems loud when it turns.  I am not sure if I should exchange it, or if they are all like this.  Please post a reply if you have any comments.
