I'm disappointed. Don't waste your money.This little MP3 player is great. Bought at a great price and has good features and performance. Loading the player is as easy as draging and dropping the MP3's like copying to a hard drive. My 9 year old son uses the player and has no problem operating it. I have two teenagers with Ipod Nano's. They like the Sansa better, so do I. The built in FM radio is great as well.I bought this to use for college and it was really good. I used this for almost a year now and it was really helpful during college.The phototent works great however replacement bulbs are very hard to find.

Its got a very handy hand strap. I have not had one problem with its performance. A good buy.This is a really great iPod case, much better than my last. The plastic on the front is very clear, which is great for watching videos. It's also very durable and well-made. I would definitely recommend this case to anyone with an iPod Video. I only wish the front part that covers the screen was recessed so that it wouldn't get as scratched up.These earphones are great. I did have a hard time getting them to fit well.

It's very warm and no more fighting to get him into heavy winter clothing gear. This was a great idea and well worth the money. It made getting out the door a little easier in these cold winter months.I was skeptical because of the low price, but this is PERFECT. No signal loss, does EXACTLY what it claims to.

Enjoy!I bought specifically because of space constraints. The receiver looks good and even better - SOUNDS GREAT!!

I have seen and used a lot of others that could not transmit well, this product does not have that problem.This thing is great!!

It's a great alternative to the blanket swaddling way.Will buy from this seller again, speedy delivery.

The small right "shift" and "back space" keys require a little getting used to. A STEAL at twice the price!My cycling monitoring with the EDGE 305 has been easy and comprehensive, it is a great product.well, I think it is a good buy... filters work great...

Very fast, good trademark and with a good programThis is a great camcorder, taking nice videos. One thing I like to see in their next version is using hard disk, instead of using tape.  Tape is not reliable. HDD is a lot easier for repeat use.Very Satisfied.  Reads receipts and business cards quite well.  Scans into other applications with no issues.  Great quality.Will keep you aware of how much gas your using. Lots of other functions, well worth the money.working fine so far.  I've found generating and uploading routes via Mapquest to be more user friendly than using MapSource (version 2009).

Not great, but I would buy again, or seek out a similar pair if available.As a beginner to using MP3 I found this very easy to use and to set up. It was a lot of fun and I really enjoy using it.This is a good one but a little bit expensive.It is an amazing camera even for someone without a great deal of experience.  The auto focus mode is great when you are in a hurry to get great pictures while driving; however, the manual focus options are unbelievable as well.  I'm glad I purchased it.This phone turned out to be just what I wanted, an answering machine with an extension telephone. It works great the handsets and answering machine have great clarity and I really like the intercome, great for my small buisness.Great buy for the price!

For a desk top, teenager's room, kitchen..etc  it is great.  Great price, good sound, and a great look that takes up very little room. I would buy again.I BOUGHT THIS AFTER I FIRST BOUGHT A HOOVER.  COMPARED TO THE HOOVER IT HAS GREAT SUCTION AND IS COMPACT AND EASY TO USE.  WE HAVE THREE DOGS AND MY HUSBAND DOESN'T TAKE HIS SHOES OFF AT THE DOOR.  I HAD LAMINATE INSTALLED A YEAR AGO AND NEEDED A CANISTER WITH GREAT SUCTION.  GREAT PURCHASE!!!!!I have these and the E3's.  These fit better in my ears than the E3's. Both sound great.  The E3's sound a little better but they were $99.00 more when I bought them. The E2's are just as good or better because of the fit.NUVI 350 - Bought it for vacation and it was great! Used it in Vegas and the U.S. Virgin Islands. So Simple. 2008 maps included in my 11/08 purchased unit. This is a great item.Best gift I could ever buy my 17 year old directionaly challenged son!
