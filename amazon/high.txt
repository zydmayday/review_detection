This is a great piece of equipment. I use this every time I work out and it works great. I especially like that it charges my Ipod when the kensington is off. Set up was easy Works great Even the wife can get from watching DirecTV to the BluRay player+ receiver with out even trying. In the old days she would call me at work "How do i play a CD?" ... Life is good now :) I thought it was great buy because i really wasn't looking for anything that had alot memory I just wanted somthing small so I could listen to music while I run. GREAT OVERALL MP3 Player! Small, light, appears durable.  And only $35 on Amazon.  Perfect for my 7 year old.  Loaded easy, nice little screen and easy to navigate menu.  My 7 year old had it figured out in 10 minutes.  A good purchase. I purchased this product for use at my office.  We have had it for several months now and it works great!  It can shred up to 11 sheets at once, no problem. It is used by several people throughout the day and works really great.  Overall a great buy! I have the best experience with this lens... works really good. I didnt find any problems... The system is great except for one little thing...when you turn it on it take a little time to load. beautiful  electronic item bright colours easy plug and play Great product, easy plug in use and fully loaded with all the maps you could ever need in the lower 48. Compact design is easy to remove and slip into a pocket while being easy to see. Shipping and delivery were as advertised. Very Satisfied.  Reads receipts and business cards quite well.  Scans into other applications with no issues.  Great quality. Great gadget, used it on our latest road trip and it worked well.  A little interference on accelleration but tolerable.

Arrived quicly and in perfect condition.  Would buy from again. Thanks Great and easy product to use. The information this little guy spits out onto your computer is amazing! It will change the way you ride / train and race. I bought this product for my boyfriend and so far he is loving it.  Great sound for such a little system.  Great for taking to sports practices and sound is pretty good when the volume is cranked. Easy to use, good resolution and color. Best feature is the auto-crop, especially when you are scanning several pictures - saves a lot of time. I don't use the photo editing software that came with it, so I can't comment on that. Great buy. Great Camera For all purposes. unlike some other reviews that state this camera is small. that is 100% false it is a good size camera with fast capturing capabilities. Great Item!! Shipping was fast and very well packaged  The mount is very good.  Well manufactured and easily mounted.  Is exactly what I needed. ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS HELPED ME MAKE MY DECISION TO BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER.  I AM NOT SORRY.  IT IS VERY EASY TO USE.  MY KIDS DO IT IT IS SO EASY.  THIS IS A GREAT INVESTMENT. Amazon not only provided me with a great product (super fast and reliable equipment) but also with great customer service when there was a slight problem with my order. Creative Zen Nano is inexpensive and great when compared to the IPOD which I feel is way overpriced.  Easy to use -I recommend it to anyone who wants to get started with an MP3 player HP Printers, especially the 1020 series such as the 1022 are very reliable printers and are great quality.  The instructions to install are easy and HP has great support. Excellent for personal use (headphone)or use with mini plug to RCA jacks for adding a true high quality component to your home theater system. A very good buy. well, I think it is a good buy... filters work great... I think it should have better case for them.. because this one is really nice but it is too big. and I dont have that much space in my bag. I would prefer 3 small cases nor this one big. but otherwise it is great I know the product, and use it regularly - good price for an additional license. I ordered this as a surprise for my husband and he loves it.  "Jill" (oneof the voice choices you have) as he fondly refers to it, has helped us in numerous situations and she is very easy to use.  Great product, easy to use and great price. As I said this has to be the best value for a 2gig MP3 player. Easy to use and download to using windows media player. Sound s great even with the smallish earbuds that it comes with. So easy to use I even got a second one for my wife. for the price, this is the best bang for a quality product.  Nice screen, good satellite reception, sound quality is great, easy to use.  Battery life is a little less than I would have expected, but this device is so small that a large battery would make it bulky.  Five Stars! Worked as advertized and it made great use of my old hardrive as a back up device. Solid product. Installation quick and simple. bought the full system - and have been very pleased.  Ranked very well for safety - the stroller is easy to open and close - and very light to pick up.  car seat is also great. The XMB-10 is a great way to listen to my XM Audiovox receiver at home. The boombox is slightly larger than I desired, but the sound is great, it's easy to use, lightweight, very portable and nice looking. Affordable, and easy to use!

It was just want I wanted and a great price too. Easy to use and good sound along with lots of other features.

Great product! A great addition to our Phil and Ted stroller. I would highly recommend this attachment! Great unit for tracking your running and hiking activities in the great northwest. Picks up a signal like a champ, even on densely wooded trails. Great product - very easy to set up and use.

Have never had a problem with Monster Power Conditioners. I found the Garmin 305 Forerunner, easy to use, accurate, with plenty of good information.  Runners need to know how far they have run.  Garmin does this and more.  The weight is good. These are great!  Sleek design and powerful light.  Much better than the old flouresant lights of days gone by.  Great for lighting tight, dark spaces that need some light to shine upon! These are great!  Sleek design and powerful light.  Much better than the old flouresant lights of days gone by.

It is easy to hear and understand the spoken directions, and we wouldn't think of going into unfamiliar territory without it. Great product, my 4 month old fits in it great.

Thanks sadly :-< Get one of those cigarette lighter adaptor thingys instead, got one and it works great. The SanDisk Sansa m250 is a great, easy-to-use, and compact MP3 player.

This thing does great, gets all the stations that come in in our area.  It is also very easy to use. Bought for my wife but I use it more.  Still haven't read the whole manual because it's so easy to use.  I may let my wife use it some. The product is great, easy to use, but by somehow it doesn't read and write on Philips DVD-R disc.

I would not have bought a higher priced item regardless of features, but I'm sure glad I bought this one. This GPS is very useful and well-designed.  It is easy to use and provides great visuals as well.  Although the GPS itself is fairly small, all the print and maps it displays are large enough to read and see easily and quickly. This helps tremendously when driving.  I would highly recommend this GPS. Great GPS, small and very easy to use. I highly recommend this. Just one thing, it does not come with the 14 page manual. You must download this yourself, but very easy to. I also bought this for my 60 year old father and he loves it too. need to get adapter.  does not come with one. :-/ This power supply was easy to install and worked great in my desktop. Just plugged and played. The Garmin Forerunner 305 has been fun to use.  Easy to understand set up and has good accuracy.  Would recommend this model to others Very good product.

Buy it. it is a good product with a good price. I believe that it is a good mark A great little fan. Simple, no frills design.

Looks great and solid in the corner of my room. GREAT BUY! Great receiver for its size. Great reception and great sound. Actualy like better than my 'super' 909. It actually pulls in signals better. If I was doing it over, I'd settle for this radio and be done. The dial is straight forward and very easy to use. This is a great scanner.  IT does more negatives at once then most other scanners. And has great image quality. This product works great with DD-WRT.  The firmware upgrade was a simple 2 step process and has been working great ever since. This TV stand was perfect!!  It was super-easy to set-up, our flat-screen plasma TV fit perfect on there, and it was a great price!!  It looks great in the living room, I highly recommend this product!

Good product. I really enjoy this GPS.  It's easy to use and gives good directions.  It occasionally gives you a longer route but not often.

Time will tell how long it lasts. Not as good as NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS but still a very good  treat! Great little player with excellent FM radio on it as well. I did not want to get into the Apple trap or pay what an Ipod costs as well. So I bought this player and have not been disappointed one bit. I use it when I am walking, on the lake fishing, and at work as well. Drops into my shirt pocket and sound is great on it. Controls are simple and easy to use. Recommned this small unit. I found this very easy to set up and get started.  The quality of image isn't great and you want to make sure there's plenty of light available or it really gets dark. One of my great investments ever... radio signal went great!!! i thought it was going to be bad, but it turned out to be great... im gettin another one for my brother... Robust, easy to use with good sound quality. Works well with linux OS and Amarok in MSC mode once the ID3 tags are sorted.

I would recommend it for an low-priced mp3 player. It is an amazing camera even for someone without a great deal of experience.

This is a very good product, I use it every day at work and its very easy to use and to keep a good backup of the most important files you would want to take every place. Perfect size and light weight to carry around (especially if you're a runner). Great sound quality.  I especially love the FM tuner (no static).  Great pricing for a quality MP3. used it for a long time and it still runs great, i use it for my phone with no problems. Excellent player, great price. A little difficult to master the remote and all of its functions. I get lost everywhere, even following directions. This product is a lifesaver and is so easy to use, easy to follow, and shows you and tells you the route to take. We highly recommend it! Great little product and price. I want to buy another one for my Mac!Very lightweight, fits easily in my laptop bag. This little speaker system is wonderful.  I have it in my kitchen.  The sound is great and it looks good too.

These Verbatim discs work great and are high quality, you get very few errors, if any at all. I got this for my workout room, suround sound was not needed, and for that, this stereo works great. I wouldnt recomond it for your primary stereo, because the sound quality is'nt the best. It gets pretty loud thru an average set of speakers, great for running:-) If your looking for a second stereo or great sound quality is'nt that important this is a great little buy. Oh yea the remote works great also. This is a great case that looks like it costs more than it does. It is easy to use and keeps your camera looking new. I own an almost new $3,000. boat GPS (Raymarine) that's hard to learn how to use, also an expensive GPS that came with my Toyota Avalon that's a pain to use, as well as another Garmin GPS.

Takes a while to get use too. it is really cool and its easy to use the only problem is the middle controle thing its hard to get used to The Xansa series of mp3 players from Sandisk looks really sleak and the music quality is just great.
