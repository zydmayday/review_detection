Very accurate SIRF chip with WAAS, beautiful, compact design that is perfect for travel.  Works flawlessly so far and I like the routes it chose for me.  They were similar to how I would normally go before I got the GPS.  Only 4 stars because it has very few GPS features compared to the Tom Tom and other devices I looked at.  But, in most cases you don't need all the bells and whistles.  This thing is sleek, very accurate, very compact (perfect for business travel), and chooses great routes (better routes than my mother's Tom Tom XL-S).  At this price, it is worth it for sure!Great product; exceptional reception even indoors and under forest canopy; easy to use software; highly recommendSeller shipped item fast and in new condition as promised.

This GPS was different from my previous Garmin Street pilot C330 in that the size was so small that it can fit it my pocket and inside the area of my speedometer in the car.  It also came with more attachments then the Streetpilot 330 in that I can recharge it in my home.  I am very pleased with this product and strongly recommend it for your car or your personal use.This card works great in our Olympus digital camera and holds a ton of photos.Outstanding product for the price.

I put them on the stands and use them as the two side surround speakers and they are excellent.These speakers are great!!  Perfect for home theater.  With the Ceiling mount clip it is very easy to install.  I used five of these speakers along with a 12" infinity sub woofer.  Very big and clear sound.  I would recommend these to anyone.  Great value on Amazon.Tim Burton creates a stunning masterpiece that keeps all the parameters typical in his productions. Combining the macabre and childish elements with stop motion animation techniques, Burton gives life to a fantastic story, just as he did in 1993 with the superb Nightmare before Christmas. The store serves the director as an excuse to build yet another visual fantasy, supported by the voices of several of his favorite actors: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney and Christopher Lee. The ironic and funny style of Burton portraying death repeats itself, forming and obscure and complex world. The principal characters are no other but a dead bride, a colorful number of skeletons, some monsters and a shy and repressed young man. The plot of The Corpse's Bride is based on a traditional Ukrainian tale about a girl murdered on her weeding day and waiting since then for her true love. In a Victorian England village lives Victor van Dort, a melancholic young man pressed by his wealthy but uneducated family to engage to a broken but aristocrat young woman named Victoria Everglot, whose parents despise the Van Dorts but want to solve their economical problems with this convenience marriage. During a wedding rehearsal at the Everglot's house, Victor goes out to practice his vows, and accidentally says the words on a dead bride's tomb, who has been expecting since her dead for her true love to say the words that magically will free her to be happily ever after. From that point, Victor goes on a journey in the land of the dead with his new bride. Down there everything seems more fun and colorful that "up there", where the world of the living is, on the contrary, almost colorless, with and aesthetic close to whites and blacks, keeping the stiffness and conservative style of the Victorian Ages. Although the title suggests otherwise, The Corpse's Bride is a sweet and sour love story with a poetic capacity very suggestive and dreamy. True to his provoking spirit, Burton bets on surprising us, letting his usual black humor to disperse over an oppressive atmosphere while the emotional theme of the film, the loss of love, is told like a musical comedy.I was very satisfied with the quick delivery. The memory works great in my son's Fuji camera.I tried to use it on my car trunk but it doesn't stick well, especially in warm temperature. Another not so useful junk in my garage.I tried to use it on my car trunk but it doesn't stick well, especially in warm temperature. Another not so useful junk in my garage.This is a great bag, well made.  It has room for all of my gear, and is comfortable to wear.  It is a large bag, but it fits me (6'1", 210 lbs).  I carry a laptop, Nikon D60 with vertical grip, 4 lenses (18-55mm, 55-200mm, 50mm, 105mm), 3 speedlights (sb900, 2 sb-r200), su-800, tripod, and various assorted accessories, brackets and cables.  There's even some room to spare!I use the Kingston Data Traveler everyday. It is very usefull, much more than rewritable CDs.PRO's - Great picture. Clear and bright.  HD is just unbeliviable! Con's - None so far This is a great TV. The menus are simple and easy to work, the setup is easy, and the picture is great. All I can say...glad I bought it!I have a big baby, and this product made it comfortable to carry him, with the lumbar support. It is very sturdy. I recommend.With the same capacity, the NiMH will definitely outperform their NiCad counterpart.Other than the difficulty to navigate through some of the menus it's overall an amazing product. Rightly priced and amazing functionality at very low weight.This is the best blanket out there.  It stays on baby, yet is roomy enough for her to move around.  Although my daughter was 12 lbs, I went ahead and got the large sleep sac.  It fits fine and leaves her room to grow.being an avid photographer with a love of altered photos, i was an instant fan of lomo cameras. the fisheye is the second one i have and i love it amazing!! plus mine is gold!i love this carseat carrier (i have 2 of them) i think it is the best invention ever makes life so much more simple i dont have to take the baby out of the carseat into a stroller just snaps in and buckles over. perfect.I found this product to be easy to set up, and chock full of features.  You can view your running path as a map, or in 3D.  And it keepe trackof all your changes in pace, calories.  Very customizable, can even change your pace ranges.  Very helpful tool!Fellowes Powershred PS-60 Shredder (3860102) was an excellent buy for an excellent product.  VERY quiet and shredder motor seems quite powerful and capable.  Very happy with price and quality.Bought the Canon Rebel XT primarily to take pictures of grandkids' sporting events.  I'm not an expert photographer, but am able to take great pictures in both outdoor and indoor settings. (I also bought a telephoto lens.) I especially like the ability to take rapid shots to  later review to choose the best ones to save and print.  The Rebel XT is easy to use and with the accomopanying software one can efficiently crop, enhance and print various size pictures.  This is the 4th digital camera I've bought and is by far the best (but not the most expensive) one I've owned.This product was recommended to me by a friend.  I purchased it only days before a 15 day cruise to 6 countries and 3 continents!  It worked great for the camera and so much more because of all the different pouches and zippered pockets while remaining a slim profile. It did double duty as my purse too so I did not have to worry about two separate items to carry when on excursions off the cruise ship. Great price, quick ship, love this product!Garmin's n?vi 350 GPS unit represents an excellent combination of performance, portability, versatility, and cost-effectiveness. Its satellite linkage is quick and reliable; it contains a comprehensive mapping data-base; its 3.5-inch screen is sharp and legible, and its audio capabilities are very solid. All that in an affordable, highly portable package. And so far, the navigation it's delivered has proven to be dependable and accurate. Not much room for improvement in a GPS product that cost $200.Excellent ear phone for the money.  maybe slightly lean in bass, but overall a fantastic value.  Recommend using Westone Comply ear tips for the best comfort and fit.We have a wildlife consulting firm and often send Biologists and technicions into remote areas to collect data.  The Garmin 60CSx is everyone's favorite for pinpointing where they are and providing location data for the record.  Reliable, accurate and easy to pack.I gave this as a holiday gift and they loved it. Instant battery boost without compromising your friend's vehicle. Beats booster cables any day.I bought Garmin 350 2 months ago and it work great, no problem, accurate guidance, clear voice, can't travel without it, love itPeronally, I love Tim Burton. I think anyone who is a fan of his will love this movie. This is a movie that I have watched over and over (literally!) and love it even more each time I watch it! The music is great, thanks to Danny Elfman, and I now own the soundtrack so I can listen to it any time! This is a great family film, although a little dark for young children. I would recommend this movie more for older children and teens, as the subject matter is a little more mature and I'm not sure if younger children would understand what the movie is about. Otherwise, this is an amazing movie. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter do an amazing job, as well as Emily Watson, Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney. One of my favorites!Great movie of Enzo Ferrari's life. From the turbulent times between racing, building cars, his family and his conscience. In order to understand and love this movies a much as I did, you have to want to know what Enzo Ferrari was thinking in order to achieve his goals and success. Mr. Ferrari tells his story to a journalist who asks specific questions that Enzo himself wonders where or how he knows that about him. The journalist seems to know as much about Mr. Ferrari than he knows about himself. But he is not asking for an answer, more like a confession of his feelings. From his son Dino dying, his drivers dying in crashes on the tracks, from the public thinking his racecars are unsafe to his double life as a father. One of the best "biography" movie I have seen yet from rags to riches in creating a legend in the racing and automobile history.This backpack is great for everything you want to do and anywhere you want to go.  It fits my Nikon D60 perfectly along with my other accessories and extra lens.  Great for travel, plenty of space and doesn't feel "too big" or "too bulky".  Great buy would suggest to anyone.Corpse Bride is magical and simplistic. Burton has invented another dark and humerous world, filmed with song and dance. The figurines are well made and beautiful. The set design is magnificent, and the story is enjoyable. An awesome group of actors provide their voices in this fun movie.This router is amazing.  It can run a custom firmware called tomato [...] that has a lot of options and a great QOS system.  QOS is what allows you to prioritize traffic so that my little sister doesn't lag up our broadband with her filesharing.Our son was 3 months old and already 24 inches and 16 lbs. He outgrew his Fisher Price Papasan but it was his favorite. This chair is much bigger, he has plenty of room to grow still. It's easy to assemble, very solid in construction, plays great music and the volume can be adjusted. You can also hook up your ipod to it to play music. It doesn't fold down so transporting is not that easy.It is very easy to create playlists from my massive CD collection & load them into this lightweight MP3 player!  Even a non-tech like me can do it easily.  Great sound, too!  An excellent choice for the technically-challenged (lol).(Again submitted on behalf of my husband, the gift recipient) - "the first time downloading maps is troublesome and difficult, but after the stress,...comes the use of a great GPS. Color display is crystal clear. Great for geocaching."Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (2005) is a stop-motion-animated Romance as well as Comedy / Family / Fantasy / Musical which takes place in two parallel worlds, in the world of living and in the world of dead. It starts in the Victorian England and tells of a young man, Victor who is to marry a girl he never met, named Victoria (Victor and Victoria in the Victorian England). Victor and Victoria fell in love from the first sight but unknown for him, Victor finds himself married to Emily, a mysterious Corpse bride, and taken to the world of dead which in Burton's movie is much more colorful, friendlier, and jollier than the world of living... With the running time only 76 minutes, "Corpse Bride" simply does not have time to become boring. It is funny, charming, and refreshingly effective in its use of the stop-motion animation in the age of the advanced computer technology. Some characters are absolutely hilarious, for example, a cute green maggot that lives in Emily's skull and pops out from her eye with the smart remarks and comments. The songs are nice; especially the one that tells the horrific story of the Corpse Bride in such colorful way that you would not stop smiling. Danny Elfman, the film's composer provided voice for Bonejangles, the singer. I also noticed the use of the elegant cutout-style animation with the hypnotizing backgrounds very much in the style of "Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed" (1926) directed by Lotte Reiniger, which is the oldest surviving animated feature film.this is, easily, my favorite lens for walking around. everything from the build-quality to the optics and the little extras they include in the box make this a really solid buy.The REbel XT is a great affordable camera that is everything that people say it is and more.  It is very user friendly and takes AMAZING pictures.  I highly suggest it.Wow - 50 sheet feeder, 20 ppm, solves my document management problemi've bought 3 carriers an this is definitely the best. extremely easy to wear and my baby loves it.The ScanGauge-II does everything it claims to do. It is very handy for watching my fuel economy, among other things. I do not regret buying this product at all.Victor van Dort, son of wealthy but title-less fishmongers, is to marry Victoria Everglot, daughter of a titled but impoverished family.  Victor stumbles through his wedding lines during rehearsal, and wanders off into the woods to practice.  Unfortunately, Victor finally gets the lines right and awakens the corpse bride, a girl who died on her wedding day and has been waiting for her husband to return.  The corpse bride, Emily, rises from the earth in front of Victor and accepts his vows. Emily takes Victor "downstairs" to her world, the world of the dead, while his true love Victoria awaits him in the land of the living.  When Victor shows up in the living world only to confess he has married a corpse, the Everglot's arrange for Victoria to marry someone else, a pompous devil who believes the Everglot's have money, Barkis Bittern. Will Victor be forced into honoring the vows he spoke to Emily, or will he be set free to marry the live and innocent Victoria before she falls victim to Barkis? In my opinion, the problems with this film outweighed the attractions.  It seemed to straddle the fence between its appeal to a children's audience and an adult audience, making it flavorless in both arenas.  It's a little too gruesome, in spite of its "cuteness", for small children, yet the songs and the shallowness left it too insipid for adults. The vocal talents gathered are among the best; Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, Joanna Lumley (I LOVE Absolutely Fabulous, sweetie-darling), the remarkable Albert Finney, Tracy Ullman, and Christopher Lee, but without a decent script their talents were stifled.  The animation was fun, but stiff in places, such as where Emily's gown was supposed to float in the wind and wound out looking like a piece of cardboard.  And the songs were awful, the movie would have been better without attempting to be a musical. Rent before you buy.  Enjoy!This bag was recommended to me by a friend, and I am grateful that I followed his advice. I use this bag to carry my Canon Digital Rebel around. You can fit camera with the lens attached plus an additional lens. There are also multiple smaller pockets for spare batteries, memory cards, remote, PCMCIA adaptor for laptop, etc. The backpack is very well built, with weather-protected zippers. Very comfortable to carry over your shoulder as a backpack, and you will get your camera out in a snap. I previously had Canon's own case for Dig. Rebel but it was cumbersome to take camera out of it and put it back. I strongly recommend this backpack to anyone with a digital SLR, even a large one.I purchased this for my nephew and he loves it.  He and his friends like to jump a small ramp on their bikes and take videos.  He also is learning to ride a skateboard and they make action movies while following each other. He showed me the software on his PC, it is really easy to use, and has a lot of clips and pictures of Tony Hawk that he uses to make movies.  He can add things like background music and special effects. Now I'm his 'cool' aunt for buying him this Tony Hawk camera -- highly recommended!Solid, stable router - hasn't glitched once in the 5 weeks I've owned it so far.  Put OpenWRT on it the moment I open the box - easy to install and configure.This thing works like a charm , does everything you need , and I can use it from car to car to motorhome ,love it!Great DVD marries well with Ferrari Victory by design, great to see the cars and the history in motion.Despite the unusual appearance, this is very convenient and works well.  My kids love theirs.Product did everything it says it can do.  Great tool.  Voice saying street names gives that extra level of support that makes a difference.I received this camera as a Christmas gift. I was heming and hawing for over a year on whether to transition from film SLR to digital, and if digital, compact or SLR. Well, I asked Santa for this bad boy.  What a camera! Impresively light weight, sufficiently rugged, great flash, quick turn on and shoot, very log lasting battery pack.  I love this camera and highly recommend it.I researched the Rebel XT in depth before my purchase.  I decided on the XT as opposed to the XTI due to the price.  I found the very best price at Amazon however, I was a little concerned when it arrived.  The camera was shipped along with a cookbook that I ordered without any additional packaging materials within a large box.  The camera was in perfect condition and I began taking pictures.  The best feature of this camera is that I can use the auto settings or manual settings when I want/need to get creative.I love this diaper bag! especially because of its design and all the pockets!! I also love the color. I have about 4 diaper bags and I never use the other ones because they never seem to have enough room and things get lost inside. I love this diaper bag because it has many sections inside so you can seperate all your items. Very nice bag!!!! and doesnt even look like a diaper bag! I also love it because I can easily clip it on to the stroller and my husband doesnt mind carrying it.I purchased the Garmin nuvi 350 for my wife.  A great product at a great price.....Clear, concise directions to anywhere in the U.S with the ability to add maps as needed.  Garmin is known for quality GPS products & the nuvi continues this legacy.  Compact size allows you to slip it in your pocket & use it as a personal travel assistant if you were walking around a major city.  It re-calculates directions quickly & accurately if you were to miss a turn.  This unit has it all.  I'd highly recommend it.Love this mini runner's computer.  Does everything plus really adds to your running experience.  I would definitely recommend to any serious runners.The Garmin Nuvi 350 was everything it was stated to be.  Easy to set up and very reliable in its performance!this rice cooker is brilliant! very simple and easy to use. It saved me a lot of time, I don't have to waste time on waiting for rice ready anymore. It cooks the best porridge! great for breakfast and ready to eat when I get up! Highly recommended.This is an excellent HDTV at a price one third to one half of a LCD or Plasma HDTV.  If you have room for the cabinet, these TV's are extraordinary values with pictures that have better blacks and truer colors than many LCD or plasma sets. The picture is astounding, even off a conventional air antenna.  The set adjusts to obtain the best picture from the signal and the analog signal can hardly be distinguished from the HDTV image.We recently used our Canon PSC-1 Side Pack on a trip to NYC and it was perfect!  It's a great, roomy size that can fit the camera and all its paraphenelia (memory cards, connection cables, etc) plus a guide book or two and our wallets.  It comes with many different pockets and compartments, plus one that's perfect for hiding money.  Yet, it's small enough to stay compact and super light for all-day carrying.  I like the extra-long strap as well, it made it easy to carry over one shoulder (across our bodies) safely.  Plus, you can't beat the price - it was much cheaper than some of the heavy-duty bags we had looked at.I always thought about buying a GPS device. After doing some homework and watching prices I made the bold move to purchase one. I'm not sorry, I did. It's a tremendous thing to have in your car. I predict eventually all cars will have them as standard thing when you buy a car. I highly recommend the Garmin Nuvi 350 pocket vehicle GPS navigator and Personal Travel Assistant to anyone. You won't be sorry you did!I bought this camera and love it.  This camera takes great pictures and the fact that it works with the EOS accessories is a huge plus.  I can use the other lens that I have without having to buy new gear. Its not too heavy and fits well in the hands.  I also purchased a 4GB card and have extra storage space. I am very happy with the camera and highly recommend it.Corpse Bride (Tim Burton, 2005) Tim Burton is a very, very twisted individual. And that is how we love him. Corpse Bride, his latest release, is a worthy, if minor, addition to his catalog. Victor van Dort (Johnny Depp) is the son of a nouveau riche family, who plan to marry him to destitute nobility in order to increase their status in the world. While he's not terribly fond of the idea, that changes when he meets Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), his prospective bride. His in-laws aren't much to write home about, but it doesn't matter; he's smitten. During the rehearsal, he is nervous, clumsy, consistently flubbing his lines and movements, and he flees into the forest to contemplate his cold feet. While practicing, he uses a convenient branch to practice slipping the ring onto Victoria's finger. The problem is, it's actually the skeletal and of the nameless titular character (Helena Bonham-Carter), who rises from the grave and claims that, since he said the vows, the two of them are now married. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Victor's prospective in-laws are fuming over his disappearance, while the mysterious wedding guest Lord Bittern (Gosford Park's Richard E. Grant) has his designs on marrying the lovely Victoria for himself. Despite the above, this is actually a simple, straightforward film. The voice acting is quite nicely done, the songs are enjoyable, the pace moves right along. Remind you any of The Nightmare Before Christmas? It should. Burton isn't trying anything new here; he's taken a new story and stuck it into the proven structure. It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's good. Not great, but good. ***Excellent binoculars with very easy to use Zoom feature which I love.  Great for bird watching.  The zoom is great for watching stationary objects but not so good for tracking a bird in flight.  No problem, as it's very easy to switch from zoom to regular viewing. The only problem is they only come with caps for the eye pieces--and those don't even fit. Otherwise I'd highly recommend this item.My son does not like the stroller or the car seat but he doesn't cry in the baby carrier.  He loves facing the crowd.  I used it while I was on vacation in Puerto Rico and it was very handy especially when I was hiking in the rain forest.  I also use this at home while I'm working around the house.  It's worth the price.Great little mp3 player.  Sound quality is great. Even a grandmother can learn how to use easily.What more can I say the review title says it all! Worth the price, noiseless and effective!Portable, clear and easy to use. I am happy I bought this and I absolutely love it. I use it in my car as well as carry it in my purse while visiting places and a great reference to quickly check for restaurants or the place you are visiting. Make sure you don't leave it in your car on display, it is a very attractive item to invite thiefs!!!This blanket is awesome!! I could not swaddle my baby in a blanket for nothing. She would kick it off in a second... so I turned to this... and it works wonderfully!! I LOVE it!! It does help her sleep too. I highly recommend this blanket. The price is well worth it.An unbelievable steal of a deal at Amazon's $199.99 price. Incredibly useful for anyone for pleasure or business. On vacation, goes from vehicle to pocket to save plenty of time for enjoyment instead of time spent searching for locations.  For business, time = $$$ in sales, this will get you there fast.  Precise, easy to use (my techno-phobe wife learned to use it in minutes), and super battery life.  A side note, as a former small town official, at this price there isn't a police, fire or ambulane crew anywhere that should be with out this GPS, minimal tax dollars for a great return!!...some have said that this unsafe, BUT I see this one thin layer under the baby MUCH SAFER than a huge puffy jacket all around the baby (both under & over = 2 puffy layers included in straps) We have this and the original.  The urban doesn't breathe as well as the original due to its wind/rain resistance, however that wind/rain resistance is a life saver in spring & fall rainstorms (where the Original soaks rain in)!With "The nightmare before christmas" Tim burton proved that he knew the art of stop motion animation. With "corpse bride" he has done it yet again. Corpse bride undoubtedly remains one of the best animated films of the year alongwith "wallace and gromit: curse of the wererabbit" and continues the dark tradition of Tim burton successfully. Corpse bride will be out on dvds soon, available separately in widescreen and full screen editions, with all these haunting features: Documentary: Find out how an animator approaches his character's motivation and why individual animators possess unique skills. Tim Burton: Dark vs. Light: Explore what inspired Burton to bring the Corpse Bride to life. Voices from the Underworld: Meet the actors behind the voices, and see how they craft their unique character Danny Elfman Interprets The Two Worlds: - Inside the Two Worlds: Includes interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and production drawings. Music Only Track Making Puppets Tick: Step inside and tour the puppet workshop. Photo gallery: The Corpse Bride Pre-Production Galleries Production Notes BUT NO TIM BURTON COMMENTARY???? Lets only hope that is included too at the last moment!!As a new butterfly enthusiast I needed a pair of close focusing binocular. The Pentax Papilio provided a light weight, easy to focus, and comfortable to carry binocular. Since I began using them my ability to see details was greatly enhanced.I recently moved to another city and at my age (73!) I was experiencing a little difficulty in finding my way around.  After rec'g my Garmin, I breeze all over town with nary a worry!My first GPS purchase. Find very easy to use, especially voice prompts, which allow you to keep your eyes on the road. A worthwhile product that saves time by avoiding pulling over to read a map. Recalculates route if you miss a turn - very convenient. Never get lost again! Like the portability and pedestrian setting so you can walk around the big city and find attractions quickly.Great boarder! This beautiful boarder is longer than many standard boarders at 30 ft. It was very easy to apply and really finishes the room.With the dual headphone jacks, and the bright picture, this is an excellent portable player to take in the car, on the plane or to have in the hotel room.  It is easy to pack, fits in most medium sized camera bags, and is very easy to use.  Both our 4 and 5 year old use its features without our help.  Great product.Great pictures, and easy to use, including the menu. Can just point and shoot, plus much additional customization. I added a Patriot 4 Gbyte high speed SD memory chip and can take 2200+ jpeg quality pictures, although the battery will require charging before running out of memory.Great pictures, and easy to use, including the menu.

I added a Patriot 4 Gbyte high speed SD memory chip and can take 2200+ jpeg quality pictures, although the battery will require charging before running out of memory.I have always preferred the linksys family of routers over the others. This is simply just a great device at a great value. You can easily customize this device with free firmware from a variety of sources, such as dd-wrt. I am using this, with additional antennas to share my internet connection from my shop to my house. I just love it.The Nikon D50 is a point and shoot but you can also make it a manual. There is a Manual mode. This camera is the best use of my money and I have and will continue to reccomend it to friends. There are neumorus great accesories that you should buy with this camera such as a manual lens and a memory card. This camera is lightweight so you can take it anywhere and with its neumours settings you can set the camera to optimal conditions.

A GREAT BUY!!!!I compared many GPS offers to the Garmin and made the best choice possible.  My Nuvi 350 will take my car to anyone's garage.  It does all but park the car.  I've downloaded my favorite cd's into the unit and have scheduled a 3200 mile vacation.  You won't see me sitting on the shoulder looking at a map.what a great little product...clear and precise directions easy to read screen and easy to input info...like the english babe voiceover..great deal ..included usb cable and electric plug in as well as the car charger..very impressedThis swaddler is perfect fr a wiggly baby that wriggles out of their swaddling or for a parent that is afraid to wrap too tight. Our little girl slept through the night if she was in this and swaddled tight enough. Life saver for new parentsThis fit very easily into my daughter's Graco infant car seat.  As the other reviewers said, it is very convenient and keeps my daughter nice and warm.  Wind has not seemed to be a problem, but then I only carry her between the car and my destination in it.  I would recommend this to a friend.Our house is completely wired complete with wireless network, and this monitor recieves little to no interference.  The sound and picture are very clear.  The features on the handheld are nice.  I love being able to see my son in his crib.  I highly recommend this monitor!!super quite !! crush little crunchy ice , great for cocktail . but no shaver ice .I bought this on a whim and did not realise its advantages at the time - but it is great!  The diaper compartment velcroes open so you can keep the top of the baby swaddled and warm while you change him - Jack loves that.  The 'Teddy Tabs' - bear-shaped velcro tabs - are adorable - we get so many complements on it.  Jack wiggles out of normal blankets.  Swaddling is recommended by SIDS organisations and to calm babies.  I often use this as a first layer and a couple of blankets wrapped around him when I'm carrying him in inclement weather (as the blankets inevitably loosen).  Definitely recommended.The new video i-pod makes long journeys shorter, lonely meals enjoyable, and enables one to store all favorite songs and pictures hassle free in to a small gadget! The only negative thing I can say is the lack of earphone quality!Moved to California a year ago.  Driving into LA scares me; high traffic, high speeds bad drivers..........this Garmin is an awesome deal.  Navigates me to LAX with EXACT directions.  Even tells me which lane to be in!!  Screen is very readable, voice prompts are dead on accurate.  Saves addresses and searches.  Locates by name, address, type of location (fuel, church, store). Bean bag mount is VERY secure and doesn't require adhesives or drilling on the dash. Tried a friend's and bought this one.  HIGHLY recommend this Garmin.Ah, Tim Buton does it again. This is his second stop-motion animation feature, the first one being "The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1990) and this is his fifth colaberation with talented actor Johnny Depp. When you go in to see a Burton-Depp film, you have a certain antisipation. It's gonna be creepy. This film is exactly that and more, along with the two's other films: "Edward Scissorhands," "Sleepy Hollow," "Ed Wood," and their most recent film, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." This film has a standout cast. Depp as the voice of the handsome and soon-to-be married Victor Van Dort. Emily Watson ("The Life and Death of Peter Sellers,") provides the voice of the beautiful Victoria, Victor's fiancee. Christopher Lee, ("Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow," "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,") voices a strict and impatient minister, who snaps at Victor for forgetting his lines at the wedding rehearsal. Hmm. The Corpse Bride is played by Helena Bonham Carter. Of course. Leave it to Burton to give the love of his life the lead role, but might I add she does a great job voicing the character. The extremely talented Danny Elfman created the gothic and(fun!) soundtrack, filled with many unforgettable and creative songs. I respect Tim Burton so much, he's a hard-working and very imaginative moviemaker, whose movies continue to entertain audiences of all ages through the years. This movie is wonderfully put together, and Tim and his crew did an absolutely magnifiecent job. Take my word on it: this movie is wonderful and very much worth seeing.Being a fan of Tim Burton's movies, I knew I had to watch "Corpse Bride" sooner or later. I finally decided to see this film, and was not disappointed one bit. The story starts off with Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp), a young man who is engaged to Victoria Everglot (voiced by Emily Watson). During their wedding rehearsal, Victor forgets his vows, drops the ring, and sets Mrs. Everglot's (Victoria's mother) dress on fire. He is ordered to practice harder if he wants to get married to Victoria. After the rehearsal, he walks through the forest to practice on his speech. He does it perfectly, and puts the ring on a twig on the ground. However, this twig turns out to be the hand of a corpse bride (voiced by Helena Bonham Carter), and since he said his vows and placed the ring on her finger, he is now married to her. She takes him to the underworld, where he must reside forever. At first, he tries his best to leave and go back to his own world, but once he learns about the history of the corpse bride, and spends time with her, he starts to develop feelings for her. Unfortunately, he also finds out that Victoria is engaged to marry Lord Barkis (voiced by Richard E. Grant), an evil and greedy man, and now Victor must decide who he loves and wants to spend his life with. The movie starts off a little slowly, but quickly develops once Victor finds himself in the complicated situation. Director Tim Burton once again dazzles us with a wonderful movie filled with fantasy, comedy and adventure. I don't know how well it is compared to "Nightmare before Christmas" because I haven't seen that yet, but I think the animation in this movie was terrific! Of course, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter did a fantastic job in providing their voices for the characters, as did the rest of the cast. The songs were delightful and added well to the movie. All in all, "Corpse Bride" was a wonderful movie which I would definitely watch more than once.This camera for the money is a very good digital slr. Quick and easy to learn.For someone who owns slr cameras i am really enjoying this camera. small and light weight,quick on shots. for the money it,s great.having digital convenience with small size and not the heavy mess i.m use to carrying aroundCuando me entusiasme en comprar el TCD649080 en ninguna parte pude observar que para poder grabar los programas de TV nececitaba pagar una suscripcion ni tompoco se me notifico que solo era para uso exclusivamente en USA. Lo compre con una direccion en Fort Loderdale por intermedio de un amigo piloto, quien me lo trajo. El equipo , claro, llego muy bien, pero por lo anteriormente dicho me encuantro muy disgustado porque siente que perdi mi dinero. When I get excited in buying the TCD649080 in any part I could observe that to be able to record the programs of TV nececitaba to pay a subscription neither tompoco I am notified that single era for use exclusively in it USES. Buy it with an address in Fort Loderdale through a friend pilot who brought it to me. The team, clear, arrives very well, but for the previously this thing me very upset encuantro because it feels that I lost my money.This is a nice bag that easily holds my Canon Powershot AND an older Pentax SLR camera.  It is definitely larger than I expected. More like a mini-pack size.  This is not the bag for just protecting your digital camera but useful if you need to carry multiple cameras or other equipment.Very good lens. I use this lens on my Canon S5 it get's the job done plus there is a setting in the camera that recongnizes the lens. Just another canon product doing it's thing. I highly recommend it you can definitely see a difference and since the S5 is known for having some noise in the pictures when using the digital zoom I just turn that off and shoot straight through the converter for flawless pictures.I purchased this product as a gift for my husband because he enjoys automotive gadgets. After pricing some other similar scan tools, it appeared that the Scan Gauge II gave you the most for your money. So far my husband is very happy with it and finds its multiple functions quite handy.Very good, simple, and compact. A good addition to a 24k topo and compass. Redundancy and durability are important for eastern forest bushwackers.My Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair arrived on time in excellent condition.  It is very handy and portable too.  I use it when my grandkids come over and they love sitting at the table with the grown ups.  It's easy to use and clean.  I would highly recommend this product.The merits of the ScanGauge II have been discussed previously.  My main concern was the performance of the gauge at temperature extremes.  Living in Colorado the gauge has performed flawlessly at temps. ranging from -10 to 140 fahrenheit in the last half year.  Highly recommended.I live in Colorado.  I have found the 305 to be an excellent tool and an excellent companion in my fitness pursuit and enjoyment of my running and mountain biking activities.  There are so many ways you can use this device to make your walk, run, or bicycling for each day more interesting.  A great motivator.Easy installation, love the Cicso security features and great wireless range from up to 3 floors making this a great investment. Compatible with WEP, WPA and more additional wireless modes for new or old wifi devices. Highly recommended!There are many features incluided in this plasma item by great price. The great image quallity, picture in picture options, native resolution, terrific sound, package of inputs and outputs, etc. are just a few things that you will have with this television. ENJOY IT!!!I ABSOLUTELY love this movie! Johnny Depp does a great job in his role as "Victor", and it just a bittersweet love story. It's not as classic as Time Burton's: "The Nightmare Before Christmas", I will admit that, but still, I favor this movie so much!!!!I like my new Garmin and especially like to cycle through the various voices (Emily from the UK is my favorite).  And it has all of the local businesses and locations I need to navigate.  Also, very easy to enter locations and utilize while I'm driving and multi-tasking.The really cool samsung TXR2735 SDTV is the most excellent and cool in home entertainment when it comes to standard-def televisions and compeard to sony and toshiba,samsung stands alone as the #1 in home televisions and because of this samsung is taking home entertainment televisions into tomorrow...and beyond.Excellent product!  Ultra portable (fits in a shirt pocket), Text to Speech feature is first rate (announces street names instaed of just turn right/turn left), very user friendly menus, good extra features like MP3 and JPG playpack, and extremely fast acquiring satellites.  Great price and fast shipping--thanks Amamzon!The iFusion system is great.  It is compact and easy to use.  Great for using at the beach,lake, pool, or even your own backyard BBQ.  The sound quality is very good.  Hours of enjoyment.Econ?mico, ligero, y veloz. Soy profesor y requer?a un scannner peque?o y port?til que me permitiera subir con facilidad im?genes y materiales impresos a mi p?gina web. El LiDe 25 ha satisfecho de manera eficiente esta necesidad. Es port?til y c?modo de usar debido a que no requiere de fuente de poder. El software de reconocimiento de textos es muy eficiente, por lo que resulta sencillo convertir textos digitalizados a documentos Word. Su dise?o es moderno y atractivo, y su funcionamiento silencioso. Estoy muy satisfecho con mi adquisici?n.The nuvi 350 is very easy to operate and an excellent value.  The receiver is a lot more sensitive than the GPS IIIplus that I bought  many years ago.  The nuvi is more accurate than the person in the passangers seat, and you can turn it off.I got these earphones as a gift for my husband and he loves them.  He is very picky about his earphones and has tried a variety of them (bose, sony, etc.) and he was surprised by how much better these earphones are.  Definitely worth the money.It's an excellent wallmount for lcd tv's, just make sure your tv matches the VESA measures, mine has 200x400 and the mount doesn't fit on the tv. The specifications only say that if fits for tv's 20" to 40".works great with my aging GMC Envoy. Gauges are accurate and the fuel estimator is also great, since i hate going to gas stations.My niece, who gave birth to a baby girl on Valentine's Day, has already taken the baby walking in the Tahoe winter with her new baby bjorn carrier, which arrived within a few short days of ordering it.  She is very happy with the baby bjorn -- said she couldn't feel the weight of the baby at all when using it! I am very happy with the speedy delivery of my gift, and the pleasure it's giving their family. Thank you.compact with small pockets for extra accessories. if you have a few extra lens to lug around, this is not for you.. you can squeeze in either two lens or one lens and flash. easy to use and the extra cushion really protects the camera.The Nuvi does its job very well. The screen is much smaller than the built in one on my last car, and so I rely more on voice instructions than visual. But in every other way it is comparable to the $2000 built in one.I have a heart condition but I also like to jog.  The Garmin enables me to monitor my pace and my heart rate so that I don't run too fast before I warm up.  It is fun to keep data and watch my progress, too.I recently purchased this bag to use for flying and can say that it's great!  Very easy to navigate with through the airport and big enough to fit all the essential gear.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone considering a bag for serious use.I recently purchased a Canon Powershot S2 IS and a lens adapter for a UV lens.  I was looking for a camera bag which would accommodate the camera and lens adapter.  This bag fits the bill!  It appears to be a quality built bag.Was a little nervous since I'm not very good with these small gadgets; very easy to use and download songs.  Love the way it automatically categorizes - great sound, nice earbuds.  Would definitely recommend!Great unit.  Very pleased with it.  Use it for road travel and hiking.  Easy to read screen.  For road travel, it lists food, gas, hotels, etc., which are nearby.  Nice feature if you pull of the road and need something.  Highly recommend this unit.I started off with this bag to hold my Canon Rebel XT with the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens.  It fits to a T and is well padded.  I love the design of this bag.  I have recently purchased the canon backpack because I have lenses laying around.I bought these as a birthday gift to my wife.  She loves them.  The sound from her iPod is superb and the interchangeable ear pieces made it easy to get a comfortable fit for her - something that was difficult with other earphones.I love my SanDisk Sansa MP3 Player. It's perfect for when I go walking, it's tucks away perfectly in my pocket. I can listen to all my favorite songs or my favorite stations on the radio which comes in great and it's very easy to use, very easy to figure out and the price is unbeatable. My husband loves it too so he got one for himself just in time for summer when we go walking or biking. I am extremely happy with it.  Thumbs up!Amazon provided excellent & speedy service at a very competitive price. I highly recommend them as a source for printer inks. Bill RobinettI got this for my 12 month old grandson. really cute and he went pee in it the frist time he sat on it. he loves to make it talk and he loves the sticker chart, so maybe he will be easy to train with this train lol. the only thing i dont like, is when he sits on the seat  his thing gets stuck on the defector. wish he had alittle more room. he weighs 22 pounds.The Canon 10x42 L Image Stabilization Waterproof Binoculars gets a big thumbs-up from me!For nearly half the price(!!!), the Canon Binocular delivers first-rate performance,with all the features you could want.Buy Canon 10x42 L binocular from Marcus Audio Video - super price,excelent service!Garmin 350 is the transition product in portable GPS systems. It has many bells and whistles that are in much more sophisticated GPS systems, and just enough features that it's functional GPS. The turn by turn navigation system is great (with voice).My Canon gives me great time, my family is v. happy. It is affordable and light. May fit any canon lense not like Nikon D. Good quality and pictures are great recent 8x12 inch very good details. I do strongly recommend it.The bag is well made and is easy to carry. It make is so much easier to grab your camera with a sling shoulder instead of a traditional backpack. Customizing the compartments and adjusting for multiple lenses or accessories is a snap.This Nuvi 350 is my first purchase of a navigation system.  I knew I wanted a portable unit, but beyond that was ignorant of brands, features, costs, etc.  I started with Consumer Reports and their testing of portable navigation systems.  They rated the Garmin Nuvi 350 as their top performer all around.  I read the features and made my purchse from Amazon. EXCELLENT UNIT.  Very easy to use, reliable, and can fit in your shirt pocket.  Besides providing maps, it also has a wide range of stored locations such as restaurants (by type), gas stations, service stations, hospitals, hotels, historical locations, and many more categories.  This makes traveling a much more enjoyable endeavor.  I recommend this unit very highly to anyone wanting a navigation unitMy 2 month old previously had the larger Eddie Bauer bouncer and hated it-too large and no fun. This bouncer keeps her very entertained. Only one problem-my child is small-and her legs barely fit under the 2 side fold-in toys. I wouldn't recommend this for a large child. Other than that 1 drawback-this bouncer is great!No nonsense ice crusher that does its job in a flash.  Plug it in, flip the switch, and start dumping ice cubes in the funnel.  It's that easy.  Super quiet compared to crushing ice in a blender.  Well worth the cost.Worth the extra $$ to save your back.  I even use this walking around the house to calm her, it works instantaneously.  She falls right asleep.  Great for doing errands instead of a stroller so you have your arms.  Love it!After seeing my friend's GPS pre-installed in his truck, I researched the market and decided on the Garmin 350.  I am very happy with "Jill", the named-voice that tells me to turn left or right, or continue straight for 9.3 miles.The SlingShot 100 is a great bag for my needs.  I use it with my Canon XTi, Canon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens  and Canon 70-300mm f/4-5.6 EF IS USM Autofocus Lens. I have the 17-85 lens attached to the camera and the 70-300 fits very snug in a compartment on the side.  The only other room I have in the main compartment is for an extra battery and a couple of smaller things.  The other pockets have enough room for a wallet, keys and phone. The rain cover is also very helpful.This item is definately worth the price. The quality is great and it amazingly increased my night time capabilities. Although the light enhancement isn't that important and as great then the infared. Anyways, this item is great for its price.After shopping and comparing several different devices I decided on the Schumacher and based on its small price, small size and ease of use, I highly recommend this product. I use it to "trickle" a Waverunner and it works great.Great product - I recently used it to map remote waypoints in Ecuador, South America.  Also, loading waypoints from a friend's Garmin GPS was seamless.  I am very happy with this GPS - great price and great service from vendor.Pro's-If your going to use the camera for a extended amount of time the grip come in very handy, Makes it easy to hold and although I can't prove it I feel as if the batteries last three times as long, Also if you use any large lens 70-200 or larger, the grip give you a more sense of "balance" Cons-It adds plenty of weight around your neck, esp with the 70-200 attached. Overall I love it.This incredibly lightweight umbrella stroller (we got the saffron one) is great for city streets. A definitely spacesaver compared to our old Graco travel system stroller--we now have room for other things in the trunk, like groceries and luggage. My one-year-old seems very comfortable in it and there's plenty of room left for her to grow.I absolutely love this bag.At first i was worried that it looked big but it's very professional looking and the red inner lining makes it very stylish too.I get compliments anytime i carry it. I srongly recommend this bagI am not a techie whatsoever and so I can't speak about many aspects of this TV. However, I can say that it delivers a clear picture and is quite attractive on my wall. My husband loves this TV.This is a dream!  It's very easy to use and you can also make your own Mocha just by adding Chocolate sauce to the milk.  Quick and easy to clean up..I love it!After extensive research on this type of product, I chose the Kensington. We did a road trip to the Oregon coast and listened to my daughter's ipod the whole time. The sound was clear and it was easy to use. Amazon's price was the best I'd seen anywhere.Great product for a great price, second one I bought from this seller.  One for me....LOVE IT!!!! and one for my nephew for Christmas.   Would highly recommend.  Fast Shipping, well packed and at a great price.The Canon Multi-pack is a great bargain if you need all color inks!  If you purchase multi-packs more than 3 times, keep an eye out for accumilating colors that you don't use and purchase the other inks  individually.Easy to set up and use.  Great software included.  Somewhat bulky, but the GPS surpasses anything out there. Works even in heavily wooded areas.= Fast download-delivery - AAA+++ = friendly and fast support - AAA+++ = user friendly programm - AAA+++ = Terminology - AAA+++ Recommended AAA+++This game pack is a great value.  Perfect for preschool age children.  These are the same games that many preschools have in their classrooms.  My 3 yr old absolutely loves playing these games.  Very educational.I enjoy the simplicity of this GPS. Also the screen resolution is awesome for the size of GPS. Very accurate and easy to use. I have seen the other large ones and this has all you need.Absolutely love these little lights!  They put off an incredible amount of light for their size, very portable and easily fit into a camera bag.  Only thing keeping them from 5 stars is the short battery life.Very cheap and nice product. GPS searching and re-calculating are so fast. Very clear and bright LCD.I got my ipod on April 23rd of 06.I ABSOULTLEY POSITIVLEY DEFINETLY love my new ipod. You can watch 75 hours of Video footage.The display is cool and i love it. Buy itLove the wide angle lens. Most of the Sony Handycams have a fairly narrow field of view out of the box. Lens screws on easily and definitely increases your FOV. I am using this for paranormal research where many times you are in somewhat cramped quarters. Best price I have seen for this item. Amazon did an excellent job with shipping. Arrived timely and intact.This product is cheaper and better than ipod, you can easily drag your music to the Sansa, it can read more types of archives than the ipod and you can view videos. I recomend this product.This tv mount is very easy to install and fits perfectly on my TV. You only need to screw it onto one stud so distance in between studs is not an issue. Would recommend. Great valueMy family has a total of 3 Garmin GPS systems... all of them work great... This one has all the essential features, especially for the price... You won't get lost if you own one of these...can now watch tv on my 3 lcd screens resolution 3840 * 1024 desktop. can now watch tv on my tablet anywhere in house with wireless home net, flawless viewing experience with my pre-n wireless router.This router provides excellent durability brought to you by the pioneer in home networking: Cisco.  If you want more features, I advise you install dd-wrt on the router.  It's an open-source firmware for the router that gives you oodles of more features.  Just google "dd-wrt". If without the third-party firmware, an awesome long-lasting router.This is a great way to get genuine Canon ink cartridges at a great price.  By packaging the various colors together Canon saves you the cost of individual packaging.  And Amazon's price is the best.Great sound, crisp, clear, very good base for the size.  I bought these for my dorm room at college so I didn't have to tear out my 5.1 set at home and they are perfect!This pocket navigator is better than advertized, the ease of use is remarkable,  easy updates via the internet.  The sound quality is wonderful. The size fits easily in my purse when out of the vehicle.This is a good buy. Great quality build, easy to install and very handy to have around. You can position your TV any way you want with ease! And the best part great value..very affordable.Great "trickle" or slow battery charger.  Used on sports car with a lot of electrical gadgets can run the battery down.  The Schumacher does a great job.  Compact size and easy to use.  Highly recommended.The Garmin nuvi 350 is a great GPS for the money. It is very easy to use and has great features. We bought it to give to our oldest son as he was leaving for college, which gave us peace of mind as parents. I highly recommend it. Dan (Kansas City,MO)This progam allows you to evaluate compliance and determine root causes of occupational injuries and illnesses.  The numerous reporting options give you the ability to view your data in a variety of formats. The desktop calendar tracks equipment maintenance, calibrations, medical exams and sampling dates.  So much information all in one place.I use this memory stick to store photos so they can be stored on a non-volatile medium.  Its very nice and easy.Great for the price. Easy to use. I can check multiple cameras from anywhere in the world. You do NOT need to subscribe to any service to access the camera. I am enjoying it.If you are used to a non SLR digital camera like i was, watch out!  This camera is GREAT!!  Pictures are clear, the time it takes to take the picture from when you hit the button, PERFECT!  When you have a baby, you must be able to snap the pictures instantly, and this camera allows you to do that.  GREAT DSLR, highly recommend!!!!!!!  Another great camera from Canon.My family chipped in to buy this for my 85 year old father for his birthday.  He loves it.  It works.  The sound and graphical interface ane very adequate even though I was concerned that the screen might be too small for him to see and operate.  He has had little trouble learning how to use the nav features and if he can use it, anyone can.My granddaughter just loves her big 'momma' chair.  She sits on it all the time, and the material is easy to clean.  I highly recommend anyone who is thinking of buying this chair.I love my Garmin StreetPilot i2!! It is very easy to use and program. I use the voice command and it leads me to destinations in the fastest way. I recommend it highly!!A little Do it your selfer so you can save a little money instead of paying someone else to do it.  It works as advertised, can't complain. And it got my car clean.Love this MP3 it has the best sound. So easy to download music. I recomend this player, so small and easy to carry and listen to when you are out for a walk.I LOVE this wall mount!  It works perfectly in the middle of two large rooms so I can turn it to have great coverage anywhere.  I've got a 40" Samsung and it's fine.I was very dissapointed in these earphones.  I listen to classical and bluegrass music.  These earphones sound thin with a total lack of any bass.  I bought Zune earphone and they sound greatthis was a gift for my girl Friend in Iraq, she uses it everyday. Loves it so much she plans on getting the 60 GB iPod.. Great item for those in the military to watch movies, listen to music and keep photo albums of loved ones back home..Corpse Bride is one of my favorite films from last year as well as being one of my favorite Tim Burton films. Tim's approach to animation in this film is absolutely amazing. If anyone can make stop and go animation look appealing, it is Tim Burton. When I first saw this film in the theatre, I have to admit I was rather surprised by the whimsicalness of the film. I was left with the impression that it was going to be a bit darker. Thankfully the whimsical feel of the film works, or at least for me it did. Johnny Depp does the voice for Victor Van Dort, a shy young man who is about to marry Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) through an arrangement with both parents of the couple. After a botched attempt with his wedding vows at the rehearsal, Victor goes off into the woods to practice his vows. He unwittingly ends up proposing to a corpse bride name Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) and he ends up going to the land of the dead with his new bride. Danny Elfman's score gives this delightful film that whimsical edge. I thought the color contrasts between the land of the dead and living was interesting and unique. I liked how in the land of the living, the colors consisted of dark hues while in the land, the colors were bright and vibrant. The choices in actors to voice the characters in the film were as always a wonderful choice. Gotta love Tracey Ullman as Victor's mother Nell Van Dort and Joanna Lumley (of AbFab fame) as Maudeline Everglot. The bonus features on the dvd were brief but nevertheless a delight to get a behind the scenes glimpse of the making of the film.I don't think he should be spanked. I think he might learn more from a couple of German shepherds instead of his brave little dachshund.The video feature is of great quality (very clear in the dark as well), and the sound feature is very sensitive,even picking up all her breathing sounds. We definitely recommend this product.I upgraded to this after a FM transmitter that only had 8 presets. I love the way you can choose any station, plus it gives no static or anything.  Highly recommend thisI love this camera, I can't say enough about it. It does great with low lighting, does great close-up. It is so versatile and isn't terribly heavy. This is a great camera.I love this camera, it photographs great, it has great lenses. Now the great thing about this camera is that you can pick the types of photographic scenes you'll be taking in automatic setup or you can customize scene exposures and other photography features like in the oldschool 35mm cameras did such as so you can get streak in lights and other effects that the old film cameras were able to do. The pictures come out superbly. The only negetive I have to say is, the manual could use a little improvement and their is a sound when you photograph that's it. If you can live with those two faults, then its an awesome camera to get. Merry x-masI love this camera, it photographs great, it has great lenses.

Highly recommend to others.This is one of if not the best film of the year! The animation is fantastic! So is the Humor, and the music and the songs written by the talented Danny Elfman. The story is about a young man named Victor van Dort (Johnny Depp) who is engaged to Victoria Everglot(Emily Watson). But he can't remeber his vows and everyone (with the Exception of Victoria)is very critical about this! So Victor goes into the woods to practice his lines. So he puts his ring for Victoria on what apears to be a stick on the ground and says all of his lines which awakens The Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Cater). So Victor's wife is now The Corpse Bride! I won't give the rest away but I Highly Recomend this movie! It has a Variety Genre's to. It's a Drama Horror Musical Romantic Comedey. So see this movie! -Douglas "The Kid of the Arts" EdwardsIf there's one thing Tim Burton can do better than anyone else in Hollywood today, it's telling a good fairy tale. He's displayed his fancy for the whimsical in the past with tales like Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish and his original stop-motion animation masterpiece The Nightmare Before Christmas. So after releasing the successful Charlie and The Chocolate Factory earlier this summer, Burton decided to follow up with a movie similar to Nightmare in style, the macabre love story Corpse Bride. The story follows Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp), the son of rich fish market merchants, who is set to wed Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), the daughter of a broke aristocratic family. Instantly upon meeting each other, Victor and Victoria realize it's love at first sight. But just as everything is about to go according to plan, Victor can't remember his vows. In fact, he's so nervous that he can't recite them at all. After feeling as though he's let everyone down, he runs off into a graveyard deep within the forest. Now alone amongst tombstones and able to collect himself, he recites his vows out loud and places the ring of his bride-to-be on what he thinks is a twig protruding from the ground. What he doesn't know is it's actually the decomposing finger of a former bride-to-be who was killed on the eve of her own wedding. Through this misunderstanding, Victor accidentally weds dead Emily, the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter). He is quickly swept into the Netherworld by Emily where he is overwhelmed by the greetings of her dead friends. All while everyone above ground is searching for Victor, Victoria's parents arrange her to wed a replacement, the evil Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant). The voice cast for Corpse Bride is outstanding. Johnny Depp (marking his fifth time working with Burton) shows great restraint and focus as the quiet Victor. Watson is as delicate and innocent as can be in her performance, and Bonham Carter evokes genuine sympathy out of viewers with her touching story of betrayal and misfortune. The rest of the supporting cast is equally good and includes memorable performances by Burton players Albert Finney, Tracey Ullman, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough. Naturally, Burton's favorite composer Danny Elfman assumes musical duties, as well as voicing the character of Bonejangles. Granted, some of the film's orchestral score tends to sound like recycled works of his past pasted together, but he makes up for this with some remarkable piano pieces that are beautiful and, at times, hauntingly sad. Burton certainly hasn't lost his touch though. In Corpse Bride he does what he does best: creates an imaginary world so multi-layered and so believable, that at the moment the film begins, you're already fully submerged into his reality. He creates a world comparable to that of Dickens or Poe, stressing his love for gothic settings and the macabre. Corpse Bride is a beautiful tale filled with magic and guarantees a good time for all.Months ago I bougth Fantom 300GB external hard drive and I can say: this hard drive works fine and is fast to show my saved datas. I'm planning to buy another one - the same - because I feel confident to save my important video files on it. I recomend Fantom external hard drives! (Portuguese:Meses atraz comprei Fantom 300GB hard drive para uso externo e eu posso dizer: Este hard drive funciona bem e e rapido em mostrar os dados guardados nele.  Eu estou planejando comprar desse mesmo produto, porque eu tenho confianca de guardar minhas filmagens nele. Eu recomendo Fantom external hard drive!I LOVE this ice crusher!  It makes the perfect size ice for me.  I use it every day several times a day as I'm an ice fanatic.  Sturdy and durable.Good quality video. Little to no feedback sounds.  Easy to use and mount on a wall for optimal view of baby.  Handheld portion is a great size for easy portability.I now have the workout of my dreams.  I love to walk and explore.  This helps to know my body and it makes it more fun to have more information.Amazing sound quality Super easy to use great features and functions nice interface great look reasonable price reliable and compact size i would buy it again in a heart beatI am in sales and the Garmin nuvi 350 GPS Navigator saves me a lot of time. I'm so pleased that I bought 2 more to give as Christmas gifts.Wow, a great driving aide.  The screen is small enough to not block the windshield but plenty large enough to read.  Programing is easy and the directions are clear, easily understood and timely.  I highly recommend this.I purchased the Lowpro SlingShot 100 All-Weather Digita Camera Backpack after having been very disappointed with several other backpacks that I'd purchased to carry my Canon EOS Digital SLR camera and accessories.  It's the most comfortable backpack I've ever owned and allows me to carry lots of stuff. I particularly love the weatherproof cover that easily slides over the backpack for those unexpected showers when traveling. It's best feature , however, is how the backpack "slings" from the back to the front to allow quick access to the camera to ensure that you don't miss those candid shots. An excellent product that's well thought out.I got this one just for fun as I'm a very amateur photographer and I can only praise the EOS350D (which is the EU name for this camera)Very, very fantasti-calistic film. Hilarious, horrifying and somewhat touching. It stars Victor Van Dort, a shy and clumsy young man. [With a strangely nice face, thanks to the stunning animation!] He is to be married to the equally shy and beautiful Victoria Everglot and when they meet, well, the inevitable happens and it is ever so sweet! During the wedding rehearsal, Victor kept doing things wrong [thanks to his clumsiness!] and he runs away with shyness and embarrasment. As he runs into the woods, he practises his vows and put his ring on a twig which turns into a bony, blue arm *shudder* and a dead, freaky lady comes out of the snow, wearing a bride's dress [again *shudder*.] She thinks he is his husband and takes him "downstairs" to the land of the dead. Another *shudder*. Now poor Victor has to choose between his dead wife, and his alive wife. [Strange, ain't it!] A beautiful, clever and hilarious film starring Victor, with his secret but strong feelings for Vicky and Emily [dead woman *shudder*] with her feelings for Victor. Wonderfully and amusingly romantic, this film takes you back in time with horse-drawn carriages and arranged marriages. It takes you back even further beyond the grave *shudder* P.S I LOVE Scraps the dead dog, he is adorable!!!This little pack is a great idea, and a wonderful design. There's room enough for your Canon digital camera, with plenty of available extra room for whatever you wish to take along. It looks great and is very well made, and the low price is truly astonishing. I am very pleased with this item, and recommend it without reservation.So I bought this camera just for fun. I'm no photographer and I just wanted a camera to take fun pictures with my friends. I LOVE this camera, it's probably not the best camera in the world but it does everything I expect it to do. The photos are just so much fun. This camera seems to take the best photos in a lot of light.I resisted this technology too long. It saves me time and enhances my enjoyment of my favorite radio programs that offer pod-casting.We love our water hammocks.  They are SO easy to fold up and carry down to the beach, and then so easy to inflate and deflate.  They are comfortable.The garmin nuvi 350 is easy to use. I love the voice prompts, especially the early warning on upcoming turns, as I don't have to keep looking the map.I'm very happy with this bag. I gave it a 4 because the bottom compartment, which holds your equipment, was smaller than I expected. Other than that, it's been very handy. I like that I don't need to carry a purse in addition to the bag, or I can even fit my purse inside of the backpack itself.I have not had to reset this router yet.  It is always working perfectly.  I love it and I love the security features.  Very simple to use.  Highly recommend.I love my Ipod... I have owned three differn't MP3 players and by far the Ipod is the best... Sounds the best and has the best options! Apple Rocks!You will enjoy this type of movie making instantly, especially in 1080p HD, the characters come to life on your set. On the technical aspect side, its worth a see!I bought this carseat carrier about 2 months after my baby was born.  I keep it in the trunk of my car and it is just soooo easy to set up and take down (one hand-seriously) and lightweight- I love it!  It steers very smoothly and is one of the most useful baby items we have now- I highly recommend it!I have had so many compliments on this watch. Mostly, the women like the pink color. They all want the pink watch band. Isn't that strange? Nevermind that the watch is superb!  Thanks for a wonderful addition to my workout! Patricia MannFits my Rebel XSi very well. Attracts smudges much, but it really protects the LCD screen very well.My baby sleeps so well in this fleece wrap.  I love it and its design.  The cotton wrap is not nearly as nice.  You will love this one.My 6-mth-old loves it, been using it since he was 5-mths. I like the adjustable height, easy to fold and carry feature, the animal theme, and most importantly the easy to clean and fun toys. My son's favorite is the lion. It's his fighting, wrestling buddy that he likes to lick, bite, squeeze and drool over. Fast shipping from amazon, easy to assemble. Keeps him occupied so I can cook while he can still see me from a distance. A life saver! Great buy for the price. The baby einstein probably works great too but with this I save $30 for the same purpose.These pads are made very well. They are all cotton, large, and well absorbing. They can be a little bulky on smaller chests. I would definitely recommend them.Not only is this carseat beautiful but it is easy to install and very comfy for my daughter. I'm so glad that I made this investment. :)Although this devices looks similar to the WRT54G, the L indicates that this device is meant to run Linux.  It has more RAM than the WRT54G and more importantly allows you to install either DD-WRT or Tomato firmware which enhance the capabilities of this router to something that costs 5 times as much! Very nice router!I absolutely love it!  Now I can take all my music to the beach or on vacation with me and am able to share it with my friends!Sweet little player! Great sound, cool features, unbeatable price!! Stick your SD card in and you'll never hear the same song twice! I'm very pleased with this purchase!!This is my first running watch I purchased, very easy to operate, very helpfull training for the NYC marathon.

I immediatly put it to a good test traveling from our home in Florida to Baton Rouge, LA and then onto Concord, NC and the onto York, PA. and then back home to Florida.  The unit was very easy to use and was very helpful in finding food, hotels and the best way to get from one point to another.

I can easily fit my D50, 28-80MM, 50MM, 70-30MM and External flash in the lower compartment. My Acer Travel Mate w/ 17" screen fits perfectly in the laptop area w/ cables. Great Deal!It's amazing that a little round tube of plastic can cost so much. But, it fits my Canon 60mm lens perfectly and does what it's supposed to.My daughter loves this car seat! Cute fabric and lots of room for her to stretch. It must be the most comfortable and safest car seat around.This might seem superfluous since you can easily swaddle in regular blankets, but the difference is the baby can't wiggle his way out of this swaddle. It's so soft and cozy. Our son sleeps comfortably, and we don't worry about whether he's warm enough (even in January in the Midwest.) Definitely worth $10!great GPS. gets excellent accuracy under heavy canopes. i've tried it in the heavy forest and city canyons. in the suberbs i get about 9ft of accuarcy. excellent features. rugged. would be nice if it had voice navagation but it's not a biggy because this gps isn't designed for driving.I bought this for my Canon A630.  The camera fits in the small pouch, and you can use the larger pouch as a purse.  I still can, even though I now have two lenses, a box of filters, a mini tripod, etc.  You can't carry a lot but it works.  Great bargain!The shipping was very fast, Thanks!!! The MP3 was in great condition and very easy to use. I would definately order again from them. Thanks again!!Easy to use and a great product!  Most importantly it's worth the money!!  Handy little gadget to have if you do any work on the computer!Exactly as identified.  Easy and quick to install and mount.  Shipping a little slow.  Functions beautifully.  Would buy another one if I needed a second one.The MX610 cordless mouse, is the greatest its worth the extra cost over a traditional wire type mouse. The added features make it a great tool.This is my second 4 GB Extreme III.  I use it on my 20D for weddings.  The card is fast and reliable and I shoot RAW.These Binoculars work great for all types of outdoor activities. I highly recommend buying them. Excellent zoom quality & havent fogged up on me once in all types of weather conditions. Plus the price is decent, Dont even bother with them overpriced Eupopean models, these are the best for average outdoorsman.My husband is enjoying his Garmin GPS Navigator. He is currently "trying it out" in his work vehicle.  Along with his other duties he worked as a GPS specialist, plotting various locations within the city, and this is 'right up his alley.' We plan to take it along as we travel.Very easy to use GPS compared to Magellan. Very accurate and reads out the street names, a very useful feature. Has extra features like mp3 and picture viewer that I do not use in my Nuvi. Just one complain, the suction cup does not hold up and keeps falling down.Foi uma de minhas melhores aquisi??es dos ?ltimos tempos. O custo benef?cio ? excelente...

Great value.Only the wickedly devilish mind of Tim Burton could concoct such a whimsical and unusual tale.  This Oscar-nominated animated film despite its rather ghoulish scenario is quite fun for the whole family.  The story deals with the prearranged wedding of Victor and Victoria, a winsome young couple who have no idea of what to expect; each family thinks the marriage will solve their financial woes; little do they realize they're both destitute.  Bumbling Victor, unable to remember his wedding vows at the rehearsal wanders into the forest and unwittingly marries Emily, the corpse bride.  Should Victor stay in this strange underworld of the dead, or should he try and get back to the living and prevent the marriage of Victoria to a scheming count? Burton deftly uses a dark image of the living world that is abruptly the opposite of the colorful world of the dead.  Danny Elfman's songs and score are perfect and Burton utilizes a talented voice cast including Johnny Depp, Emily Watson, Helena Bonham Carter, and Albert Finney.  There are some dazzling images and the "go action" animation is quite inventive.  All in all, while not a classic film, CORPSE BRIDE is an entertaining 77 minutes.Fell in love with this camera first time I tried it.  Easy to use, colors are great!  Ordered telephoto lens to get the really great pictures.  Love it!!!   Amazon is great too, always a pleasure to deal with !!My Son has bee using this sine he was 4 months old and he loves it.

So I give this 5 StarsThe XL SleepSack fits my two year old and, in addition to making sure that she remains covered all night (we keep our house pretty cool), it prevents her from learning how to climb out of her crib :) She started in the small SleepSack and has progressively grown into each of the larger sizes... she loves her SleepSack and I love the comfort of knowing she is safe and warm in her crib.Great right out of the box and ready to use.

The combined weight of the mount and screen is about 130-150 lbs - so make sure you have something very solid to mount it on.We bought these for our son for Christmas and he loves them. He is in college in a triple room and finds it hard to study if his roommates are watching TV or just socializing.

It's a darkly gothic, yet beautiful love story about a young man, Victor who accidentally marries a corpse while practicing his wedding vows. His 'bride' Emily had been spurned by her lover in life, and is desperate to find love with her new groom, whilst the hapless Victor wants only to return to the land of the living and his beautiful fianc?e, Victoria. Meanwhile the sinister Lord Barkis Bittern is determined to step into Victor's shoes and marry Victoria himself. Filmed in stop/motion (like Nightmare) the film has a surreal but captivating air. The living world is colourless and dark whilst the land of the dead is a vibrant, lively place, full of music and colour...a nice twist on the usual view. Tim Burton has once again teamed with Johnny Depp (the voice of Victor) and his real life partner Helena Bonham Carter (the corpse bride). He also uses the voices of other well-known talents such as Joanna Lumley, Richard E. Grant, Tracey Ullman, Christopher Lee and Jane Horrocks to name but a few. Danny Elfman composed the music for the movie and with his usual flair has matched the mood of the film perfectly. The DVD has been well produced and there are several featurettes including a music only track, interviews with Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, production galleries, and a look at the actors performing their voice-overs. This is a quality film on a quality disc and well worth adding to your collection.Got the Waring Pro Ice Crusher and have to say it is great.  Makes crushed ice perfectly and effortlessly.  Littl nose, looks great, easy to use and clean.  Sits nicely on the cabnet.   It cruches ice to small sizes, perfect for cocktails.  Really am very pleased with this item.

Plus it is very acurrate and announces street names.This is a great video monitor, a mush have. Great sound and video. Gives you peace of mind to move about while baby sleeps. Easy to use.I used the Nuvi GPS for the first time today and I think it is wonderful.  The screen is very clear, the operation easy, and it worked perfectly. I am so pleased I got a GPS with the text to speech feature, it is very useful and greatly aids navigation.  The voice instructions are so clear that I really didn't need to watch the screen at all.  I purposely took wrong turns to see what the GPS would do and it recalculated an alternative route within a couple of seconds (and it sounds so patient!!).  I highly recommend this very useful and fun gadget.Amigos tugas!!!

Extremely heavy duty and well worth the money.I love everything about this MP3(I got 2), much easier to navigate than any iPOD :) It's worth every penny .easy to use, tracks everything, i love itI am deeply invested in Canon EOS film and digital cameras.  The Rebel EOS 350D XT 8MP black body is a great addition.  It will easily pay for itself in photo sales.Bought these for my husband and he loves them.  A little pricey but he thinks they are worth it.My wife uses it all the time and loves it. It works smoothly and reliably, very convenient. Highly recommended.This is a great little recorder for students at a great little price compared to some of the others.Great product at a great price.

Arrived fast and well packaged.I purchased the Garmin Nuvi for my parents.  It was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition.  My parents say that it is very easy to use and they love it.my mom loved this digital picture frame she said it was the best mothers day gift everLo que me gusto de este control remoto es la programaci?n a treves de la pc, sin embargo me desencanto un poco pues la interfas de usuario no es la idonea, pero al conocer el  programa me diverti agregando mis dispositivos y las actividades. Lo que no me gusto es el material de la carcasa es muy delicado y facil de da?ar, espero no romperlo tan pronto, hubiera sido mejor si le con material para absorver golpes. A la hora de usarlo con mi Centro de Entretemiento en general me siento satisfecho.Set in a 19th century European village, this stop-motion, animated feature follows the story of Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp), a young man who is whisked away to the underworld and wed to a mysterious "Corpse Bride," while his real bride, Victoria, waits bereft in the land of the living. Though life in the Land of the Dead proves to be a lot more colorful than his strict Victorian upbringing, Victor learns that there is nothing in this world, or the next, that can keep him away from his one true love.wow...all i can say is wow...great lens, with available 30mm wide angle and super fast f/1.4...what more can i say...love it, would recomment to anyoneI used the Nuvi on a trip to Utah and Nevada.

He quickly and easily downloads photos to his ipod.  He is definitely using his digital camera more these days!Compr? este reproductor hace un par de semanas basado en las revisones de otros usuarios. Antes ten?a un reprodutor Creative y este lo supera en un 100%. Todo lo que promete el fabricante se cumple. La duraci?n de la bater?a es de alrededor de 11 a 14 horas. El fabricante constantemente actualiza el firmware del equipo. Entre la cosas negativas que encuentro de este modelo esta el control con una especie de Joystick que es un poco complicado de usar al principio. Lo segundo negativo es la poca facilidad de pasar videos al formato exigido. A pesar de que el equipo viene con el software Jetaudio y permite el traspaso de video, esta operaci?n a mi no me ha resultado. Lo tercero es que no trae un estuche para guardarlo.. (se vende por separado) En conclusi?n, comparado con otras marcas es mucho mejor. Si tuviera que comprarlo de nuevo.... lo har?a.Mucho mejor de lo esperado el producto, muy f?cil de navegaci?n, de cargar la m?sica y en men? muy intuitivo, lo ?nico medio molestoso son los aud?fonos, un tanto inc?modos, pero cuesti?n de adaptarse. RecomendableEsto es para los de habla hispana. Este DVD Recorder es de batalla, trabaja muy bien, yo estoy viviendo en la ciudad de M?xico. Es muy flexible a la hora de editar video como por ejemplo acortando t?tulos, quitar comerciales de programas de TV, nombrar tus t?tulos. Excelente. El programar las grabaciones que quieras de tu TV es muy intuitivo y f?cil de usar. La grabaci?n a DVD no es complicada, ya que teniendo los t?tulos en el disco duro, puedes escoger de entre los que tengas y pasarlos al DVD. Lo que s? no pude hacer es ver este DVD en mi DVD de mi computadora, a?n tengo que ver por qu?, pero se me hace raro, porque los DVD players pueden tocar estos DVD sin ning?n problema. Gracias.Easy set up. Get the friction stand. You can easily move into any vehicle. Modern tech at its best.Excellent binoculars!! Everyone that bird-watches also wildflower-watches, mushroom-watches, butterfly-watches, bug-watches, etc., etc while they are out walking around. These binocs allow you to do all these seamlessly. The close focal range is amazing, but they still have a wide-enough feild-of-view at a distance so you can find birds easily. Great quality optics. Very lightweight also, very comfortable on a long hike.Nice colors, very light. One thing to improve: the lateral pocket (there aren't useful).Very maneauverable and great capacity item. Must buy. Saves a lot of extra baggages.The Kingston data traveler is an excellent product and very useful. I recommend it.Excellent, adjust to my monitor (Samsung 204b), very easy to install, and very stable.This portable speaker seems great, small and compact.

Would highly recommend.We absolutely love this mattress.   It's very light weight while still being very firm.   It fits very tightly in the crib.

No lo volveria a comprar.I love Tim Burton`s movies, and this one its not the exeption. great movie, great music, great storyBest Air Cleaner I ever had....beautiful design......very quiet CADR 130...Filter change indicator make that one perfect Air Cleaner...........Very exquisite, powerful, the only issue is battery lifeThe best hand-held gps so far....

Para mis asistentes de Investigaci?n, los mapas mentales construidos en este magn?fico software ilustran con rigor cient?fico la ruta de un proyecto, con sus pposibles alternativas y les permiten a partir de ah? desarrollar nuevas ideas.Exelente producto por DFI. Lo recomiendo 100%. el CMOS del BIOS es impresionantemente cofigurable. Nada dif?cil de ajustarlo a nuestras necesidades. No da problemas para instalar RAID's en Windows XP. Trae hasta una herramienta para sacar Jumpers. La refrigeraci?n es muy buena, tal vez un poco ruidozo el FAN del NB, pero del resto trae disipaci?n pasiva. :) Me gust? mucho esta tarjeta madre. L?stima que no la adquir? en vez de la MSI NEO4 Platinum que esta si que me dio todos los problemas del mundo. NO SE LA RECOMIENDO A NADIE. MSI Ha bajado calidad en sus productos. Lo siento por ellos.what can one say about a lens hood.  It fits the 100 400 zoom and it does it's job.Cool.  Does everything you need a GPS to do.  Easy to use.  Very sensitive antenna.  Fast satellite acquistion. Highly recommend this GPS Handheld unit.Order was delivered to us at an extreemly fast pace especially at an excellent price.Me gusta muchoel producto , su peso es genial, lo mejor es la pantalla, la memoria es compartida con el video eso quiere decire que es de 512 - 128 eso es un defecto pero es muy rapido, lo tengo en una red inalambrica y funciana perfecto la velocidad es buena. El peso del equipo es adecuado y se puede trabsportar facilmente. En pocas palabras es un a buena compraAll I can say is "WOW" I am amazed!!  Great Price and and amazing GPS!!  I highly recommend it!its real deal sharp pictures very happy on this product highly reccomended to everyone.10 starVery expensive, very rugged, very flexible, but not a walk in the park to install.Es un excelente producto y funciona bien. Lo tengo instalado en Costa Rica. Al principio tuve algunos problemas, pero adquir? un nuevo router, de los recomendados por Slingmedia y solicit? a mi proveedor de internet que abrieran los puertos y listo. Cero problemas. Eso s?, se debe de tener acceso a mas 512 kbs, para que se pueda ver bien fuera de casa. Para aquellos que tienen wireless es una bonita opci?n para tener tv en cualquier parte de la casa.Excelente idea de hacer unos altavoces que mejoraran un poco el sonido de la consola PSP. El unico inconveniente que le veo es que si tambien tienes el cargador - asidero, no vas a poder usar ambos porque ocupan espacios iguales. Es por esto que se hace dificil cargar con ambos accesorios al  mismo tiempo.Este es mi segundo WRT54G, ahora "GL". No he revisado el firmware de linksys, ya que inmediatamente le puse Tomato, sin embargo es un router de muy larga tradici?n y personalmente nunca he tenido problemas con la marca Linksys. Estuve pensando si comprar este modelo o el nuevo "G2" o alguno de la nueva serie, pero si bien son m?s estilizados, no creo que ofrezcan la versatilidad de estos, sobre todo este modelo que es compatible con Linux y por medio de firmwares alternativos se puede sacar lo mejor de su hardware, como es el caso con Tomato u otros como dd-wrt, openwrt, etc. Lo utilizo conectado a un modem adsl en modo "bridge", as? que el router hace la negociaci?n PPPoE y adquiere directamente la ip p?blica, me ha resultado muy confiable, lo recomiendo.Excellent value works great very little mistakes and everything was included (accessories).Este producto es muy bueno, aunque en algunos momentos se inhibe.My grandson and his parents love the exersaucer.  It really entertains him and allows him to learn new skills while having fun!!!It's worth the money.  Great gift for kids who loves music.Cuando compre era la mejor bateria aaa  que hab?a al mejor precio. La calidad y duraci?n son excelentes. Recomiendo ?nicamente la compra de ?sta o de la energizer, son las mejores. No desperdicien su dinero en otras marcar. Por ultimo quiero dejar en claro que le he puesto cuatro estrellas y no cinco porque una semana despu?s de haber comprado encontre (no en amazon) que ya existe la de 1000 mA que no hab?a ac?. Busquela por las dudas antes de comprar.Very pleased with product. Very accurate. Locks on GPS satellites quickly. Compass and altimeter are very useful features.El trasmisor funciona bien. Nada excelente pero tampoco nada malo. Al menos puedo escuchar mp3 en mi carro. La calidad del sonido es bastante aceptable y con poca interferencia. Lo mejor es que puedo escuchar mi musica aleatoria.ESTE ES BUENO PORQUE ES pLUG AND pLAY Y PARA PASAR VIDEOS Y FOTOS CON SU SOFTWARE QUE SE PUEDE BAJAR DESDE SU SITIO WEB ES FACIL, DEBES TENER EN CUENTA DE POSEER LOS MP3 CON BUENO idTAGS PARA QUE QUE LOS PUEDA ORGANIZAR ES BUENO !!!!This definitely has expanded my picture taking ability and its fast. WORTH THE PRICE>Great.. The price, the configuration, i recomended.Highly recommend it. Recipes are easily recorded. The Search feature is fast and efficientBinoculars work great and are lightweight and easy to carry around in my purse.We love our Garmin Nuvi 350.  Very pleased and would recommend it to others.I absolutely love this camera!!!  Takes great pictures and is very easy to use.A persar de que las comparaciones son odiosas, al ver esta pel?cula surgen constantemente las comparaciones con "Pesadilla antes de Navidad" (PADN). En mi opini?n no llega a tener el ritmo ni la profundidad en la historia que ?sta ?ltima. Aunque a nivel de imagen considero que los a?os han pasado a favor de la "Novia Cad?ver" lo cierto es que ni en la historia ni en la m?sica alcanza las cotas de PADN. La m?sica es muy parecida y la historia es bastante m?s floja y mucho m?s predecible. Hay elementos como el perro del protagonista en el Inframundo que son como el perro de PADN. A pesar de todo estoy muy satisfecho con la compra de este DVD y la recomiendo encarecidamente. Respecto a los Extras, te enteras de algunos detalles pero tampoco aportan gran cosa. Lo que s? me ha gustado mucho ha sido la opci?n de poder ver la pel?cula solo con la banda sonora.Los Motorola Talkabout FV200AA GMRS son muy buenos equipos considerando su bajo precio. Los hemos utilizado en una distancia de aproximadamente 500 metros en l?nea vista en la ciudad y la recepci?n es muy buena. A 200 metros en la ciudad sin linea vista la senal se pierde. Los compre para mis hijas con el objetivo de ubicarlas en espacios abiertos en un rango de 250 metros y para este uso funcionan muy bien.Este aparato realmente ayuda a oir tu musica sin contratiempos ni interferencias como otros, realmente es muy recomendable porque ademas de tener tu musica en tu stereo ayuda a tu ipod a que no descargue nunca, ideal para cualquier viaje o para la ciudad. Simplemente perfecto!!Small, lightweight, easy to install, great scan results, wonderful for home, office, travel, at a great price.I love this camera.  Great for the family to take great quality photos.  Very easy to use.Reci?n lo he comprado.  Tenia muchas dudas si comprarlo o no.  Por que habia leido en los review, que se demoraba mucho para bajar las fotos. A penas lo compr? y despu?s de cargarlo, lo primero que hice fue probarlo.  Le meti una tarjeta SD que tenia y le baje las fotos.  Me pareci? que bajo rapidamente, no es lento ni rapido, podria decir que se demora lo que uno se demora cuando bajas la informacion a la computadora. Me gusta por que es peque?o pero algo pesadito. Lo que mas me gusta de esto, es que te sirve para bajar las fotos de tus tarjetas de memoria sin el uso de una computadora.  Es muy ?til cuando uno sale de viaje o quiz?s cuando est?s en una reuni?n y un amigo toma una foto que quisieras, simplemente le pides que te preste la tarjeta y lo bajas en tu wolverine. Lo tengo poco tiempo, as? que todav?a no le he encontrado algo que no me guste (si es que lo tiene)la c?mara es incre?ble, pero el lente al ser un Zoom no es muy luminoso, por lo que hay que compensar con el iso de la c?mara, incluso 1600, pero ah? la imagen pierde nitidez aparece el grano.Excelente creo  que  no  hay que  hablar  mucho  de ello, su capacidad lo dice todo.......Comprenla son problema simpre llenara sus requisitos....Al fin encontr? un control remoto que realmente es universal, porque tiene una gran lista de dispositivos con sus c?digos, y si no estuviera en la lista, se puede programar, para que aprenda las funciones desde el control original. Funciona perfectamente en mi televisor Aiwa, para el que no encontraba control que le funcionara, este si. El unico defecto que le encuentro, es que el material parece un poco fr?gil y resbaladizo, se me cay? una vez y ahora tiene un ruido en el interior, como de una pieza quebrada. Totalmente Recomendado.Es buenisimo, tiene una excelente calidad de sonido la duracion de las baterias es buena mas de 16 horasExcelente Camara Digital. Deberian incluir una tarjeta de memoria para completar el kit. La calidad de la Cam y sus infinitas funcionalidades. Software y accesorios completos.Mi mam? es entomologa y los compr? para ella... mas que usarlos podr?a decir que los ha disfrutado...! la imagen es excelente y han sido muy utiles para ella..!! Los recomiendo mucho!Muy buena, muy rapida y a un exelente precio, que mas se le puede pedir a una memoria.great product ,  fast delivery , i love the lowepro for carring camera equipment.  thanks again.EN EL DIA DE HOY RECIBI DOS CONTROL REMOTO PARA USARLO EN UN TV PHILIPS 42 LCD Y CREANME FUNCIONA IGUAL QUE EL CONTROL ORIGINAL. LA ENTREGA DEL PRODUCTO FUE A TIEMPO. ESTOY MUY CONTENTO GUARDE EL CONTROL ORIGINAL Y ESTOY USANDO UNO DE LO QUE COMPRE. EXCELENTE, BUENO Y BARATO. OJALA PODER DARLE 10 ESTRELLAS EN VEZ DE 5.El IPod es muy bueno y a un muy buen precio gracias a Amazon. Lo recomiendo ampliamente tiene una muy buena cantidad de memoria a un muy buen precio. graciasConsidero que su mejor caracter?stica es su velocidad de lectura/escritura, aspecto q la hace muy apropiada para trabajos profesionales. Si bien es cierto, existen presentaciones con mejores rates en estos aspectos, la Extreme III es excelente. Personalmente manejo varias memorias de 2 o 4 Gb y la Extreme III se presta para esto La recomiendo.SAMSUNG TR4266X/XAA DLP TV Stands Beautiful product! Sturdy, easy to assemble and a perfect fit!Asi es, la verdad me ha salido buenisimo, la bateria dura lo que debe de durar, aprox unas 8 horas.... Vino en buenas condiciones y es peque?o, cabe en la mano.... Lo recomiendo para corredores de media maraton, acaso piensan gastar 1GB de m?sica en todo el recorrido? lo dudo!This is a wonderful camera. Great price, well worth the price. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.fast and reliable..well worth the moneyI love it.Excelente telefono, por eso se gano todos esos premios, lo unico malo es que lo meti en la lavadora de ropa y hasta ese momento duro.excelente equipo compatible con linux , me permite efectuar y colocar programas en linux dentro del router. alta potencia 250 miliwattrecibi el equipo bien y sin problema , el unico detalle es que se tardo mucho en llegar, expecificamente se tardaron mucho en enviarlos, pero los recivi sin problemas y funcionando bienI Think great!! Yo lo recomiendo ampliamente ya que he comprado dos monitores de este tama?o y son grandiosos!! Luis M. Cort?sExcelente reproductor no solo en tama?o fisico sino de capacidad, muy solido , unicamente flaquea en momentos con los videos pero aparte de eso un excelente reproductor.Este equipo es muy bueno, le permite supervisar de cerca la evolucion de tus ejercicios. El color es muy lindo y agradable. Lo compre para mi esposa y esta super feliz y super delgada gracias a la ayuda y la informacion que este reloj le brinda en sus ejercicios. Lo recomiendo.Very quiet monitor without the static.  Also very lightweight and easy to carry around.Canon OEM at a lesser price.  You can't beat it!  Excellent price and service!estas baterias recargables las compre como extras para mi camara dsc w-5 sony y tienen buena duracion y a un excelente precioGreat price, very sturdy, plenty of flexibility in movement and rotation.El pen drive es de buena calidad, practico y facil de manejar, la velocidad de lectura y escritura es excelente. Recomiendo este productoEste juego de fitros es una excelente opcion de compra para la calidad que tienen,cada uno cumple su trabajo a cabalidad;enroscan perfectamente en los 58 mm para los que fueron dise?ados,tiene su rosca macho que va al cuerpo de la camara o adaptador y rosca hembra,para recibir otro filtro adicional o un filtro de uso diario para protejer al que dejamos fijo en la camara,(casi siempre el uv;en mi caso.) Recomiendo altamente esta marca. espero que les sea de ayuda mi opinion. Exitos!I love it...I can watch all my favorite videos and movies...Oh my Gosh!! It's really cool...totally worth it!!Compre la rebel xt primero por el precio, soy dise?ador gr?fico y trabajo con webs, y esta camara tiene suficiente poder para dedicarme solo a la fotografia profesional. He usado antes camaras canon y son muy buenas pero esta es una buena opcion para quienes inician en la fotografia profesional o fotografos mas avanzados. Tiene 5 puntos de enfoque que se pueden manipular para lograr efectos muy buenos, y una rafaga de disparos continuos de unos 12 disparos en unos 2a3 seg. Como detalle tambien les aclaro que el lente ef-s 18-55 que trae se queda corto para hacer acercamientos entonces tengan por seguro que tendran que adquirir otro lente. Otras baterias tambien son otra buena opcion para comprar puesto que si usan mucho el screen para revisar las fotografias se consumen bastante rapido.  Bueno, la verdad yo si la recomiendo.Tuve el placer de escuchar el Hifi de Apple, el Onstage de JBL (muy bueno pero carece de control remoto), el BOSE y el Klipsh IGroove. Termine comprando el IGroove. Definitivamente el mejor entre los anteriormente nombrados. Ahora bien, tiempo despues, vi el Klipsh IFI por internet. Me llamo la atencion por que tiene Subwoofer. Siempre me ha gustado el toque que le da el subwoofer a la musica, de manera pues que no me pude aguantar y lo compre. Este es definititivamente el mejor de los mejores. La calidad del sonido es espectacular. Si tienen el dinero y el espacio (es mas grande que los anteriormente nombrados) no les quepa la menor duda de que este es el mejor equipo que le puedes colocar a tu IPOD. Lo recomiendo ampliamente.Tuve el placer de escuchar el Hifi de Apple, el Onstage de JBL (muy bueno pero carece de control remoto), el BOSE y el Klipsh IGroove. Termine comprando el IGroove.

Una gran cantidad de opciones y lo mas importante con una gran calidad!!! Estoy tomando mi primer curso de fotografia y la verdad cada vez me demuestra que es una gran camara. 100% recomendada.Estoy muy contento con la c?mara, el ?nico defecto que le he encontrado es que el volumen al grabar video MPEG4 es exageradamente bajo....  parecen pel?culas mudas y ruidosas.  Por lo dem?s es muy buena.Useful, adds important new features. Highly recommended.This tiny little disk is absolutely excellent, very handy, very fast, very slim therefore very portable.
